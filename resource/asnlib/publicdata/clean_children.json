recommendations programming honest much programming became devops engineer book design patterns elements reusable object oriented software authors erich gamma richard helm john vlissides ralph johnson big feel like first everyone list use reference manual rather sitting reading front back things build may enterprise grade fancy good understand design patterns think ways applied solving specific problem find writing lot boilerplate code probably better way recommended book code complete edition author book steve mcconnell another book everyone list one beefy boy essentially encyclopedia best practices pragmatic guidance comes tons examples digrams help explain best practice concepts teach better programmer thinking things differently would originally refactoring code recommended way go starting unit testing well code always bugs build fault tolerance software etc etc recommended book refactoring author martin fowler book quite good getting new position need take new codebase often times find walking dumpster fire code need know best way approaching refactor take time introduce unintended side effects code originally start adopting idea leaving code cleaner found time comes take sprints refactor complete codebase done revisit different sections code normal workflow recommended many book video recommendations talk little progression career may help people understanding go next gotten first position position jr systems administrator location datacenter learned problem solving critical thinking break problems small chunks note position title misleading glorified help desk operator taking calls working tickets think title existed slotting servers basic administration first job bright eyed bushy tailed company small datacenter located far lived time small business park point really know much ton self leaning job went company required pass microsoft mcsa certification windows server involved certifications wholly unprepared even microsoft recommended least solid years experience dedicated windows administrator even attempting test even understand windows active directory even needless say failed first exam twice never ended getting part mcsa importantly got moved night shift got calls tickets time spent learning new technology thought interesting also looking things could improve daily working life example deprecated old bare metal servers would need wipe hard drives came install baseline linux image get ready reslotted knew pxe booting thing really whole lot worked read wiki watched videos ended standing pxe boot server us use would automate process wiping hard drives installing image automatically needs plugged network port test bench process taking small bites large problem googling grasp happening also learned basic bash scripting install lamp linux apache mysql php stack linux system writing script line line running worked main point important sit try things understand work position cyber security operator location soc learned understanding security scripting time python see one coming jr sysadmin working cyber security well turns manager helped getting first job developed specific interest security interested position paid way better datacenter absolutely hated working nights applied place ended getting offered position started working learned previous position basic networking concept firewalls active directory basic websites worked etc learned quickly security things time huge shoutout rnetsec community essentially every day read new security write ups open source software found interesting cool around nice community months studying went took network comptia certification concept applied last position applied im lazy want build something would make life easier work time playing eve online quite years coming across corp member also happened like year cc programmer helped really get idea programming actual language rather bash scripting chose python first program ever wrote calculator many times ship number ships would need pass wormhole cause collapse stuck correct side moral story example find something automate write something make project ended also creating auto hotkey script would write number security event tickets required per day essentially day spent understanding open source software found rnetsec worked came across term concept understand would learning position security engineer location electronics conglomerate learned depth security basics engineering cloud aws job super remarkable learned specifically nice getting title bump essentially doubling salary time leads next point title change difference entire job families really much difference cyber security operator engineer long write resume selectively putting job duties focus building things breaking engineering tier job titles beneficial title resume basically always engineer anywhere go goes operators analysts architects etc example really engineering operator know write scripts time learning job reading design patters see book put resume built scripts automate workflow security events within daily activities technically lie actually job description always tailor resume job applying even going back previous positions tailoring experience geared current position trying get learned mostly basics aws like load balancers vpc etc administrate security appliance case secrets management system wrote commandline utility positions senior devops engineer location tax healthcare faang companies current position learned everything sun infrastructure code post getting little long winded ill probably end repeating essentially getting devops process previous jump sysadmin security tailoring resume making sure apply time outside work downtime inside work learn new things case development operations devops new fullstack engineer vast quantities technologies need familiar effective list ones use day day top head aws eks cloudformation ssm helm kubernetes bash docker golang python groovy java networking various different programming specific frameworks time ive learn ton technologies similar things differently enough knowledge directly translate like jenkins octodeploy ansible salt stack essentially similar things operating model capabilities different closing notes tips interviewing beginning pretty much take positions offered time gain confidence interview company rather company interviewing comfortable teaching things limit job searches things include area expertise like use django look positions python webdev django jobs teach framework use work soft skills probably one important tips soft skills get door get people like people like willing help give break bar rat couple months really helped harness natural charisma general conversation find social hobby puts uncomfortable situations help always money budget role think average role money table probably closer confident ask world agree put technologies completely know resume fine put things small

variable instead opinion reasons firstly python spans broad range program formality levels write code global scope someprogrampy import os filename oslistdir ospathisfilefilename filenameendswithtemp osremovefilename basically treating python like bashbatch except million times better order allow kind programming python already predisposed treat files list instructions execute order compare java

opposite end formality spectrum write python files everything tucked away classes functions file designed import regard command line usage particular file well python already predisposition run code global scope separate parsing mode would know one use say love name main would prefer separate main magic variable true false main name string still fine purposes like printing module screen matter fact whenever upgrade python script quick prototype reusable code always move main code c like function called main via template def mainargv point usually argparse return name main raise make
