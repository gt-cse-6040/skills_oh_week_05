    "ctkypf": "hi all firstly this is going to be a long post to hopefully help people genuinely looking to commit to becoming a developer by sharing my story of how i went from absolutely zero knowledge of programming as you can see by my post history to landing my first python developer role location uk to kick things off about a year ago i wasnt happy with the jobs i was doing long hours very low pay so i came across python by chance yes i admit the money was what attracted me alone to start off with as i am quite a money motivated person ofcourse i knew and still know it will be a long journey to reach the salaries offered but i have managed to finally get my first step on the ladder by landing a job as a python developer enough of the story lets get on with it i will list all of the youtube playlists and channels i watched over and over again bear in mind whilst reading these books i did watch a lot of videos in between reading aswell what books i read in order first book python crash course a hands on project based introduction to programming eric matthes review great first book my advice skip the game and django project and just do the matplotlib project for now come back to django later down the line once you understand the http protocol and how requests work 1010 recommend ps i know a lot of people recommend reading automate the boring stuff and i regret not reading it after this one book 2 learning python mark lutz review very good book for getting a grasp on python fundamentals i would not of read this without first reading python crash course you will need to supplement this book with looking up videos on youtube for a deeper understanding as this book is very dry to read and long 1400 pages i found a pdf format online for free to read dont need to buy it 1010 recommend supplement with videos book 3 programming python mark lutz review very good book i would not read this book word for word skim through the book to get an understanding i would ignore following the projects in the book dont spend too much time on it ignore tkinter chapters 610 would i read again its worth having on your computer to refer to imo you can find this online for free in pdf 1300 pages from here on i pretty much decided after researching jobs and where the demand was for python developers that i was going to learn django and learn the web based side of things from here on out most of this from here on is django specific so if you want to learn python for data science or another area you may want to use this as a template and just change the books and videos to meet your needs oreilly has a bunch of books on python there are also so many videos on youtube to help aswell before you jump into django flask wouldnt it be best to learn how the internet works first learn from my mistakes and learn this first before django i believe from memory there is also a part 2 learn what the http protocol is learn how requests are sent to a server learn the difference between get post put delete learnt that great lets move on resource book 4 django for beginners ws vincent review absolutely great first book for learning django i would highly reccomend also following alongside this book to get you started 1010 this is a must read imo book 5 i keep hearing the words api and rest wtf are they have no fear my friend watch this first rest apis with django ws vincent review great book to learn how to use django rest api and how it works 810 would recommend however it isnt a very big book and i felt the book wasnt great value for money i felt at this point i was starting to ask questions in my own mind when reading code on how things could be implemented and expanded on and i felt this book could of had a bit more detail rather than just pointing to external resources however this book does get you going on how to use django rest and sets you up nicely to learn more advanced material at this point i was starting to consider when i would be ready to start applying to jobs start jotting down ideas for any small projects you want to make for myself it was an rest api app showing crud functionality and a working django website i learned basic html and css to have a better understanding of how templates work and how objects data is sent from the backend and displayed in the front end and vice versa htmlcss series youre still here congrats i had done a lot of reading and hearing about data structures and algorithms and how you needed a computer science degree to learn it book 6 cracking the coding interview gayle laakmann mcdowell review what to say about this book wow this book was a massive learning curve for me considering most days i was spending 6 8 hours committed to learning some days i would only manage to get through half a page this book took me 6 8 weeks to go through from memory all of the examples are in java so i had to look up corresponding tests in python and reverse engineer to see what was going on 1010 this is an absolute must read for anyone buy it read it understand it stick it on your shelf read it again in the future videos to supplement cracking the coding interview book also has a corresponding video course on youtube by the author this helps a lot this is also a fantastic resource in python ahh yes i think im ready to apply for roles slow down there young spud we are not finished test driven development harry percival review must read must read no excuses get it done go through it twice follow the projects every single interview will involve questions about tdd from here i wanted to have a better understanding of the internet so i read computer networking a top down approach review if you do want a better understanding of the internet networking then skim through this book as soon as you understand http protocol tcpip then close the book and move on 610 not a must read but nice to know from here on i didnt read any other books most of my time was spent creating my projects to put in a portfolio watching more videos getting confused and solving my own problems by building a site using django and learning along the way and reading the official django documentation to keep it short and sweet from here on out i am just going to list the youtubers who truly helped me out technically and also keeping my motivations high corey schafer 1010 not going to list any other independent python tutorials this guy is all you need freecodecamp fantastic resource so much on here only watch what you need to learn dont get caught up in trying to learn everything the channel has to offer the two channels above are all i would recommend for video resources freecodecamp also does a good sql for beginners which is worth watching for any developer other channels 1010 worth checking out andy sterkowitz chris sean my personal favorite traversymedia and thenewboston are both great channels as well for a slightly different way of explaining things if you truly do get stuck interviews so after i made a few projects and uploaded them to my github i put the github link on my cv aswell i made a linkedin profile aswell you may experience a bucket load of recruiters contacting you if you have set up a new linkedin my tips for dealing with recruiters based on my own mistakes always tell them what you are looking for do not let them push you forward for a role or arrange interviews on your behalf for roles you are not comfortable with if they are aggressive and abusive yes i have had this simply hang up the phone block their number and move on tell them i am looking for a junior python role using django only or similar framework ofcourse you can edit this to your area of knowledge i had so many phone calls i stopped accepting calls as over 50 of calls were roles that were too senior for me or calls about roles i had already appliedspoken about i set a voicemail up telling them to email me and i will get back to them take this advice please it will save you repeating yourself 20 times a day you have had an email about a job role they will usually want to speak to you on the phone first however i learned to reply along the lines of please understand i get contacted frequently by many recruiters please can you send over a job spec for me to look over prior to arranging a call this works majority of the time if they dont reply trust me you havent lost out they may ask you on the phone where have you already applied for be confident and simply reply i would rather not say hold your ground its your own business not theirs if they have a role for a company to put to you then lets hear it be respectful and polite but dont let them push you around many will try to they have told you on the phone about a company you have already applied for sorry i am already engaged with that company they will press you on this with who how long ago what stage are you on once again simply say i would rather not say i have never had a recruiter push me after i have responded that way salary what are your salary expectations what salary are you on at the moment my advice simply reply well what does the role pay its as simple as that if a company cant be open and honest about what the salary range is for a junior level role are they even worth wasting your time on your current salary is nobodies business your answer i would rather not say if you apply directly to a company through their own website indeed or any similar jobsite they may ask for salary expectations i did put in salary expectations for my current job when i applied directly so just know when to do it and when not to applying directly with a good cover letter has most of the time netted me a positive response if you have got this far i have no doubt you can become a developer yes i am only junior it has been a long road for me and the learning curve has been insane i have gone for weeks on end sometimes thinking i am not getting anywhere and wondering when the end will come you are not alone its a small sacrifice in the long term if you truly want to make this your career interviews if you manage to land a phone call andor a face to face interview here are my tips do not put anything on your cv you do not know in detail it is easy to expose in a technical interview 99 of the time questions will be about your cv what do you know about the company why do you want to work here do your research i usually tried to memorize 2 3 things in reasonable detail about the company it shows a good interest in them go on their website read what they do learn it memorize think why would i want to work here answer that with a good answer and you should be good to go dress smart yes they may wear tshirt and jeans to work you do not work there yet business dress all the time shirt tie suit if you can edit i am in the uk business dress based on my own work experience in the uk is standard for most jobs if you are unsure of dress code ask your potential employer prior to interview as i dont want to mislead anyone be friendly polite act keen not desperate would you like a drink of coffeewater before we start the answer to this is yes please you will need that water to sip on when your mouth goes dry haha ive been there trouble answering a question relax pause and just say let me think one moment if you dont know the answer just say i dont know the answer its good to be honest i have always had a good response by being honest when i have not known the answer i hope this post will help you if you are struggling to find a path i wish you all the best and good luck tldr if you want to change your life read it",

    "he7vpy": "about 5 years ago i started to study programming on and off as a hobby i love reading articles posts and books about python and autohotkey and during these years i have done some webscraping projects and scripts for myself nothing too complicated just enough code to do what i needed and that why i still consider myself a newbie as someone who uses lots of free open source software i always wondered if someday i would find an open source project i could actually contribute to it could be anything but finding something is just so difficult everywhere i looked all the projects were either too complicated for a hobbyist programmer like me or used a programming language i do not know but this weekend i got lucky as i was trying some packages or plugins for my favorite text editor sublime text i noticed that one of them which i use extensively could be improved by adding a very simple feature without thinking too much about it i opened an issue on github asking the plugin author if he could implement it but then i remembered that sublime text packages are coded in python and decided to check the py file by myself i usually have trouble reading other people code but to my surprise this code was simple enough that i could understand it and even better the feature that i wanted to see implemented could be added with just two lines of code so that exactly what i did after that i looked for some git tutorials to learn how to make a pull request i had never used git before double checked that my code was ok updated the project readmemd file and commited the changes fortunately some hours after that the plugin author accepted the changes i proposed and they were uploaded to all the package users mission accomplished so fellow hobbyist python programmers dont stop looking for a project you can contribute to one day you may find it even if it takes 5 years",

    "gdzu6e": "so i work with a financial firm we had to go back and get quarterly statements from december for all accounts its over 350 accounts not all the statements are similar some are a couple of pages and others are 15 20 pages the company that generates the statements sent us a pdf of all statements that bad boy was over 3800 pages long so as we are doing these reviews we fill out review paperwork and then we have to go through this huge pdf to find the corresponding account when i search for their name it literally took 20 seconds or more to search the whole document then i have to print the pdf and just save the respective pages then save with the name of the account last night i thought id try a pdf parser ive done some general python but nothing like this i used pypdf2 im going to go through my thought process but i cant really post code because it honestly a mess and i dont know if my boss would appreciate it at the end ill pose an issue i had and state what i learned i had to find a way to find where the first page of each statement was guess what they all have page 1 of so i parsed each page and had it return every page in which that string exists then i had to find how many pages were in each statement since the page number varies so if index 0 and index 16 contained that string then i knew 0 15 were one statement now im able to split it but i needed to save it with the filename as the account number heck yes the account number is listed on each first page and the account number begins with the same three characters i iterated is that the phrase through the document i grabbed the first page of each statement and set it as the first page then i got the index of the next page that has page 1 and just subtracted 1 then i searched for the first three characters of the account number and when it found it return the index then grab the following 7 characters which is the complete account number then it wrote the files issue so when i was actually splitting the documents it kept running out of memory i was using visual studio code i have 16gb ram and task manager showed it hitting 25gb before the process was killed because of memory i had to go into the loop and change the beginning index ever 25 30 pdfs generated i was trying to find a way to allocate more memory but i couldnt find a way any help is appreciated if the code for the loop helps i may can post that part what i learned this was incredible while it was obviously a challenge it took 20 minutes to pip install pypdf2 and then get it to not throw an error in visual studiowindows 10 it amazing to fathom i was able to actually do it it took 5 hours the so was shocked that i was up until 3am but i couldnt stop the loop was pissing my off because it kept generating the same statement i am not sure what really fixed it because i made a couple of changes at one point and it worked my boss is freaking beaming right now im beaming he called me in to his office 20 minutes after i showed him the final product he asked if id be willing to take on some more of this automation during work hours hed take off some of my workload and also give me a 15 raise it been a ramble but if you made it this far then you obviously are resilient enough to be a programmer edit i want to add this for those of you like me even if youre newer than me you can learn the language watch videos do practice problems but it takes a tremendous about of resiliency and patience to produce real world and practical applications it took a lot to learn what very simple for others i probably looked at 50 web pages trying to find an explanation that made sense i wanted to give up a couple of times but i really wanted to come in to work today with a finished productso i work with a financial firm we had to go back and get quarterly statements from december for all accounts its over 350 accounts not all the statements are similar some are a couple of pages and others are 15 20 pages the company that generates the statements sent us a pdf of all statements that bad boy was over 3800 pages long edit2 i am in shock this isnt in writing but apparently the raise is verbally approved but they are working to get paperwork drawn up right now and this is all verbal ill get the raise i just got an email from our it guy that he was told to find a top of the line programming computer as my boss apparently put it so when it formal ill be getting a dell xps 15 i9 64gb ram 1tb dock dual monitors he it said that it probably way overkill but the boss said to get it anyways boss asked if i thought about this full time i was honestly so nervous and still am i just said heck yeah dave he said all the little programs you make are property of the company and they are not to leave the laptop he also apologized for being so resistant in the past about implementing various technology that i had recommended he then asked how i can learn about more stuff if i need to go to

    "f48ojm": "hi guys just a quick motivational speech as this week it has really paid off for me ive been learning python for around 6 months now and have found myself in the perpetual tutorial loop as i think most newbies find themselves but now i started a new job which allows the use of python and in the first week i took on a new task from my new boss long story short i took a task they allowed 3 weeks for the creation of excel surveys to be used by internal team leads and had it done in two days around 15 spreadsheets are populated with 5 to 10 changing questions and will require analysis thereafter they fully expected me to spend weeks putting together said spreadsheets and all their permutations and email them out instead i created a csv of all the data required and took the data and used python to generate the surveys updating when changes happen in the back end the survey files are then formatted by openpyxl and spat out with a filename title as each team lead any changes to the structure of the surveys mean just changing one or two lines of code not going into every single file to make all the changes the script takes 075 seconds to run they allocated 3 weeks needless to say worth it and everyone is happy so if youre stuck in tutorial hell my advice is to find a work task to accomplish because i reckon i learnt as much in the past 2 days with this task as i have learnt in the past month edit meant to say i was only able to get this reasonably high paying job because i told them i started learning python 6 months ago and will be using it to automate tasks without that i wouldnt have got it about a 75 to 100 pay increase on my last job good luck",

chucking stuff at random forests doing bayesian inference with pymc3 and survival analysis with lifelines i dont use a lot of tensorflow or pytorch because they tend not to fit the domain of my problems well but i revisit them every few months to pit them against our existing models disclaimer this post is purely my opinion and in particular reflects my view that people too quickly jump to mldl methods when traditional methods could do better obviously this is very domain specificyoud struggle to generate meaningful text with a linear regression two final points before diving in there is a lot of content between the sources below dont feel you have to read and understand them all by any stretch but dont expect to be on top of this stuff in a week or a month three months is probably the minimum amount of time required to get a feel for this and more like a year to be useful to a third party domain knowledge is super important if you are interested in a particular industry read up on that too to make yourself saleable learning resources python basics nothing here is specific to data analysis so take a look at the rlearnpython faq in general good data science often looks to the outside observer like software engineering its not enough to build something in a jupyter notebook and be done many claim success in productionising notebooks and all are wrong so you also need to learn about version control git is the de facto standard and if you understand that youll be able to pick another vcs easily enough note that ides such as pycharm give a friendly interface to many commands but you still have to know the basics packaging unit testing i like pytest data analysis theres no getting away from the fact that mathematics is at the core of data analysis but you dont have to be john conway to be useful in addition statistics is by far the most important at this level and you dont need to understand the minutiae of the subject which is based in measure theory and is tough unfortunately ive never found a good introduction to statistics with python there are plenty for r so you have to dip into a number of different resources all of statistics pdf available here perhaps not all but larry wasserman has written a very approachable introduction to statistics here the link includes the few data sources given in the book but its very much a textbook at 500 pages its a bit daunting so i recommend focusing on chapters 111 first then the chapters on linear regression and multivariate models which is about 200 pages total read along with the scipy docs in addition take a look at pythonfordatascienceorg which calls out useful functions in scipy and statsmodels openintro statistics an alternative and possibly a better alternative to aos this textbook is available with an optional contribution and used by a number of colleges in the us ive not read it but a closer look it appears to be pretty great as with aos youll have to read along with the scipy and statsmodels docs linear algebra done right currently available for free from springer this covers a lot of ground in 300 pages less immediately applicable than the stats books but definitely worth keeping for the future python data science handbook jake vanderplas is the author of the excellent altair plotting library and a pretty bright chap this book serves as a good introduction to numpy pandas matplotlib and scikit learn and the link includes its full text as jupyter notebooks which is awesome you neednt bother with the scikit learn chapters unless you want to jump ahead python for data analysis and the pandas docs which of these you prefer is largely a matter of preferring one medium over another but pfdas second edition is already slightly outdated for pandas 103 though certainly not enough that its not a very useful resource data science from scratch joel gruss book kinda does do what i assert isnt possibletake you from zero to data scientist hero in a relatively short text the criticism i would level at it is that it necessarily doesnt go into sufficient depth everywhere but what it does brilliantly is implement most things from scratch duh to give you a good grounding in the basics anatomy of matplotlib this is a great video to get a better understanding of how to work with matplotlib which is definitely the least pythonic library still in use by data analysts today its also slightly outdated but hugely valuable introduction to survival analysis lifelines docs great introduction to survival analysis which will either help you look like a superstar or be completely irrelevant winning with simple even linear models i was at this talk at pydata london a few years ago and it was the best of the conference in my opinion vincent makes the argument that people are too quick to leap to mldl methods when simpler models could do as well or if not better the visual display of quantitative information if you buy one book on visualisation it should be this if you buy two it should be this an the grammar of graphics data science briefly herere a few resources that cover data science proper but dont expect to get here any time soon rdatascience includes all the other resources in this section the elements of statistical learning and an introduction to statistical learning the former goes into more detail on the maths than the latter pattern recognition and machine learning andrew ngs machine learning course data sources as mentioned before if youre interested in a particular industry then see if you can get data related to it otherwise these are some general sources of good quality data scikit learn data has some really good toy datasets that are useful for playing around with descriptive and inferential statistics besides the skl estimators datagovuk and datagov have hundreds of thousands of data sets many of these offer a great opportunity to practice cleaning up data with pandas because they come in all shapes and sizes openintro statistics data sets used in this textbook out of scope the following topics havent been mentioned in this post yet because i consider them adjuncts to the main theme but will probably be of importance sql probably very important big data possibly less so but in general the problems of big data are about finding efficient ways of doing the same stuff with big data inc eg pyspark etc

    "lmi2lg": "hello all it finally happened i became employed as a data engineer after self studying python for around 8 months and sql for around a month or two for reference im based in the uk and older than 30 i lost my job as a traditional scientist around august last year and had been at the mercy of a company doing data scienceengineering incorrectly overfitted models zero subject matter expertise dog shit data so i took it upon myself to teach myself and prove they were doing it wrong little did i know i ended up discovering something i really enjoyed making sure everybody is getting the right data after around 2 months of applying for jobs i was contacted out of the blue by a company hr department which was local who were looking for somebody to join their team as a data engineer this was pretty much nothing to do with my skill level and was 99 luck and being in the right place at the right time as the technical questions werent as hard as other roles and the role itself is very new in the company i say nothing to do with my skill level because i really dont think im qualified for this job yet i also happened to be interested in a field which is popping off at the moment so entering a market into a huge demand definitely contributes to success i had a total of 5 interviews data engineer webscraping python developerconsultant i still dont really know what this job is i took the interview because it was an interview test automation engineer data engineer business intelligence data engineer financial services all of that aside i think it worth going over some stuff which might useful a lot of the skills in the learn programming subreddits are often a technical discussion and help even from a science background there a lot of similarities in the job search the assumption good skills alone are enough to land the job unfortunately due to an influx of anybody being able to call themselves a recruiter job hunting is definitely another skill that all programmers looking to get their job should learn in order to navigate getting strong armed into less than desirable positions for less than desirable conditions i was unemployed back in the tail end of the 2008 financial crash as well and over time i realised having the experience of job hunting and dealing with job specs interviews offers recruiters was extremely helpful i completely understand that a lot of people in here may have never been in full time employment before so i thought itd be useful to highlight what still relevant culture prospects location money i would say these are pretty much the things that should drive your decision to get a job you want to work with fun decent people in a place which dont think youre a robot you want a job which can either take you places at that company or kick start your career it has to be somewhere you dont hate living you want to get paid fairly of course not everything is set in stone and it very much recommended to decide what you skimp on ill echo something i learnt in science offering to be paid less than the market value might help you now but really hurts the industry as a whole know your worth and stick to it for reference here the lowdown on a job i turned down vs the job i accepted turned down recruiter constantly asked me the same questions over and over again is the location okay because you live far away and are you sure you have experience using python to which i answered yes i did 3 interviews for them first stage was a classic verbal interview where the director literally left on the minute of the time we had allocated for the interview cutting me off mid sentence second stage was a technical task which i received feedback of not being great this was because it was below the level of a developer at no point did i say or suggest i was at a developer level i was also applying for a junior level role although invited me back for a third interview third interview was a series of quick fire technical questions with rightwrong answers this whole process took 5 weeks spent another 2 weeks telling me they were still looking at other candidates so we are at 7 weeks for an interview process threw me an offer mid week and wanted me to start monday at the beginning i was so excited for this job although over time began to despair that this is the only job i might get took all of this shite on the chin anyway and began planning my exit strategy fortunately a different job came through interview was carried out as a hr staff member found my cv directly on linkedin emailed and called me to schedule an interview manager was extremely personable and interested in hearing my motivations giving me plenty of time to express myself also over ran the interview by ten minutes as we were getting along they called me back on the within two hours to arrange a second stage interview second stage interview was with said manager and the analytics director same format of being relaxed and asking a mix of scenario and experience based questions in order to see my approach to solving problems rather than how well i knew the documentation they also took the time at the end of the interview to get to know me more which was a really positive sign i was offered the job about 3 hours after the second stage with an explicit instruction ill be mostly working from home for the forseeable future and my start date will be at the very earliest in two weeks this whole interview process took one week the relief and joy i experienced when i got this job was immense and made me realise that being desperate is a dangerous thing know what youre looking for googling is a highly underrated skill and it can be pretty crazy seeing people who are amazing at googling for solutions to programming problems although completely forget all of that whilst job hunting what not to search for software developer jobs london software engineer jobs wales these are honestly the worst things you can search for because they will give you every result for every language and youll spend a lot of time sifting through shite you dont want to apply for how you should search language developerengineergeneral job title location jobs eg javascript front end developer new york city jobs sometimes it better to be lucky than be good i mentioned earlier getting the position i did was not about skill and more about being in the right place and that something i want to touch on here in the end as self taught programmers university graduates and people looking to change careers all we want is a chance to prove ourselves in order to get that chance you might have to face a few rejections and apply for stuff you might not necessarily be qualified for right now although if you honestly believe it a job you can do given some time and training and you want to prove that then every time you see a job application just send your cvresume in it doesnt cost anything and the worst thing that happens is they say no and you arent ready yet mindset whilst jobhunting is just as important as technical ability because with a weak mindset youll never get the opportunity to show what youre really good at i hope this was useful to somebody and good luck with everybody also looking to get their first job special thank you to you guys at rlearnpython for helping people getting answers to their problems and just generally being a non judgmental helpful sub you guys are dope af edit what courses did you use courses i did here i also used kaggle free courses to get an introductory feel of data science in terms of study plan it was extremely unstructured and i kind of liked that because it meant i could work on what i wanted to work on instead of following a regime which would mean learning stuff i didnt want to learn or wasnt ready to learn yet",

    "jwgatc": "hello all i recently wrote a post about getting my first paid job on upwork i got rehired by the same person to do even more work with the conversation going like this client this work is great now can we do the same for everything please me as far as im aware all of the fields are filled could you give me some more detail client sends me a search page you see all this info here all 39 pages could we do exactly the same for all of these please client said it much nicer than this to avoid any confusion i got asked to scrape a whole website of financial data and condense it into a spreadsheet this was a pain in the tits for the following reasons the pages in the first post were static this is a dynamically loaded website it a lot more data it ended up being over 18000 data points it needed a lot more code long story short i managed this and got it in on time and got paid i enjoyed it so much i ended up making it a data pipeline if you can even call it that where it scrapes the data passes it to a function which saves it to a csv and then passes the csv to pandas to have it cleaned and formatted all in one jupyter notebook cell 5 months ago i didnt know a single thing about code and now i can do this it amazing and id love to be able to give some people a realistic opinion as a beginner to other people starting out tutorials are a bit misleading as with all people learning im sure youve probably watched tons of videos whilst theyre useful it can be very disheartening watching somebody cane out code in 10 minutes which takes you 3 hours here a video which made me feel better i saw this as i was transitioning out tutorial hell and it was very sobering how a lot of what he said happened i spent a lot more time searching for solutions and running the same blocks of code with minor adjustments over and over again until it did what i want than i did watching my code work also actual time spend coding was a lot less than checking for ridiculously small things like unmatched brackets my code was literally trash and a mess which didnt make any sense whilst i was doing the job huge chunks of code which worked and commented out as i was trying to fix things code which didnt work and i forgot to delete random comments i made whilst i was angry my code worked though and it something the client never sees after i finished i took the code and made it way cleaner just in case anybody would want to see it judging from what more experienced people have said this is the normal cycle of programming and thinking youre going to one shot code is the mindset to failure programming is about problem solving and problem solving involves running into a lot of problems and when i say problem solving i mean a lot less if jack has 3 apples and jill has x n^2 apples come up with an algorithm which sorts out a list of even numbers and every odd number produces the word lmao i would say problem solving can be summarised with figuring out why your code isnt doing what you want it to do googling stuff and copying code is normal i used to feel like such a joke googling stuff for solutions and being unable to rattle stuff of the top of my head same with copying code other people have done and subbing my own variables in there after about 2 months of doing this this is pretty much what programming is like so dont feel bad if you do this is normal nobody feels guilty when they copy a recipe off youtube to impress somebody and nobody should feel bad for taking publicly available code and adapting it for their own purposes within reason getting out of tutorial hell i spent about 4 months in this stage ive done three courses overall and felt the same all the way through me following along means im learning unfortunately this isnt true i ended up wondering why people were doing stuff the way they were doing it rather than understanding what was going on one of the most asked questions on here is im a beginner what should i build and usually people say the same projects which are projects 100 other people have documented and fine tuned the obsession with using some sort of phrase involving the word build or building gets bandied a lot around here and i do think the concept is poorly explained although is correct i think the more apt advice for getting out of tutorial hell is come up with your own ideas and then build them building what youre interested in and is useful to you is very different than churning out programs hundreds of other people have done and is the beauty of being self taught getting over that hump and generating your own ideas is a steep very rewarding learning curve ultimately from what ive learn from tutorials is that zero courses teach you how to be creative and if you cant be creative programming is really really hard my example projects before this huge one above was a password manager and a program to automate my computer to begin mine crypto when my electricity is cheap i also made loads of other stupid shit like a bot which spams annoying messages in chat channels with a sleep timer to avoid getting timed out spamming email boxes of people who have sent me junk mail with scary pictures i came to the conclusion that all of the stuff i like to build is incredibly troll and that totally cool as long as i dont use my powers for evil on a grand scale which brings me to my next point have some fun learning python and programming always felt like a race to me how much time will it take for me to become a paid full time programmer was always on my mind and to be honest it ruined a lot of the learning for me ive had a lot of down days because it felt like i was slow compared to these people on youtube who became software engineers for the faang groups in 6 month or these 15 year old kids winning google coding competitions i felt like i was missing out on earning a lot of money because of a lack of ability rather than realising the only person that sets the goals posts is me comparison is the thief of joy after all putting yourself under a lot of pressure to get somewhere is definitely a path to burning out my missus told me the other week that i looked tired and when i looked up at the clock i had been sat at my computer for 6 hours without a break whilst i dont disparage working hard i do disparage disconnecting from your health take a break go for a run spend some time with your family build stupid shit which nobody will ever see every once in a while build your github as soon as you can this is something i learnt far too late edit elaborated on below i say build a github because a lot of people goals are to become a software engineer or developer and a lot of people are also self taught although there no really good way of showcasing your projects and what youve done on your resumecv github is what developers use as part of their pipelines and a lot of jobs expect you to be able to use so if you have a github showcasing your work it shows your portfolio and suggests you at least know what github is if you start late like i did youll have a bunch of concentrated commits into your repository which doesnt look very professional and isnt visually very encouraging a steady stream of projects over time shows that youve put a bunch of effort into either submitting projects or contributing towards other projects and helps boost the strength of your application your career aspirations can change and that okay too i have a background in chemistry and was enamoured with the idea of becoming a data scientist what i learnt from doing python is two things i really like collecting data and automating things i really hate analysing data and that alright with me i know what jobs i should be looking for now of course this is all just my opinion based on personal experience i always recommend going out there and getting your own i hope this was helpful to some beginners edit wow holy shit this is a lot bigger than i thought thank

i spent time at htmldog learning html and the very basics of css but actually spent more time in photoshop creating layouts and splicing them up i then learned more of css as i moved on to creating templates for forums do we all recall proboards for our favourite video games hobbies and tv shows during this time i also learned some javascript and actionscript because no worthwhile site at the time didnt have a flash based splash screen this all stopped at the ripe old age of 16 flash forward to my early twenties i got the urge to pick up programming again with the idea of learning to become a web developer mostly as a hobby i did however have an awful career in retail and was hopeful i might one day be able to transition into a programming career it was at this time i also discovered python thanks reddit i spent the next 12 months learning both webdev skills html css frameworks and now properly learning javascript and slowly falling in love with python i subscribed to every python subreddit forum learning resource and youtube channel i could find in particular i went through the entirety of learn python the hard way which gave me a solid foundation and also went through the codecademy track and freecodecamp unfortunately this was the point that i fell into tutorial hell i became completely reliant on tutorials i wasnt able to think up projects and implement them by myself all i could do was follow a tutorial from beginning to end and not even always to the end and honestly not understand half the code that i was typing i did make a conscious effort not to copy and paste code but without truly understanding what the code i was typing did it didnt really make much difference this began a yearly cycle of getting into python following tutorials until i burned out not learning much and then just stopping this rinse and repeat process happened over and over until i hit my late twenties i had spent literally years wanting to be a professional developer but had never felt confident enough in my skills to go for it i occasionally sent out a job application for junior positions hoping theyd take me on in the form of an apprenticeship but looking back i can see just how laughable my applications were i had nothing to show in the form of a portfolio nothing that wasnt just a rehashed tutorial project with a few variable names changed and some different choices of colours during this period i did manage to escape the dreaded world of retail i landed a customer service position in supply chain for a large company and from this managed to form a real career working through the various departments that existed there this was great for my self confidence and my wallet but it absolutely did not excite me i had started doing things like project euler advent of code and other similar coding challenges and i found that i loved them they gave me a challenge without many clues of how to solve it and i had to just go at it with python to try and get a solution obviously i would get stuck and then hit the search engines but this was one of the greatest lessons i had every learned it is okay to search for the gaps in your knowledge these challenges pushed me to learn all kinds of programming concepts id never really come across before and they did it in the form of a game i learned about recursion regex proper uses of functions classes and dictionaries and creative ways to iterate through them and so much more best of all once id solved these problems id head over to their communities and look at other peoples solutions this was a game changer now i could see how my brute forced but successful attempts were clumsy and how i could have written them more elegantly and efficiently id go through this very positive feedback loop of solving these problems searching when i needed help and then comparing with others and repeating and it felt great eventually i realised that id built up enough skills doing this that i could actually automate a few of the more boring tasks at work i read through the highly recommended automate the boring stuff by al sweigart and off i went in about 12 months i had automated nearly every report i had involvement with automated all date collection from our various suppliers and customers and even managed to use pyautogui to automate some of the mind numbing and repetitive tasks i had to do in sap where i was only allowed access to the gui no scripting i created a few flask apps that allowed me to do some of this and share a bit of it with some close co workers too but mostly i kept this to myself early on in the process of doing project euler i had created a github to host my solutions so i regularly added and updated my scripts on there to at this point i had completely fallen in love with programming i wanted more i needed more i knew at this point that i would only become more miserable in my current career and decided at this point that i would aim to gain employment in a junior software position within 12 months and then covid came this was a blessing and a curse the job market became a mixture of stagnant and more competitive due to all of the lay offs but i had way more time on my hands thanks to permanent remote working during this time i threw together a few simple web dev projects so i had something of a portfolio but more importantly i tidied up all of the scripts id been using at work and threw on some readmes explaining what they do and why id created them i sent out regular job applications during this time for all kinds of positions then in january it happened i applied to a small company that specialises in open source software and they got back to me asking if id like to interview i spoke with the managing director and explained to him why im interested in the role why i thought id be a good fit and then went through some typical interview questions we got on well and it turned out that the software they create is similar to the software that i was using and automating every day sap i then went on to a second interview this time with hr and their lead developer where i was asked some question on how i would solve several problems in general terms i didnt have to actually code anything this went well and i was offered a junior position the following week im now just over 6 weeks in role and i feel absolutely in over my head every day i hit wall after wall of problems i have no idea how to solve and feel like im constantly fighting our framework of choice but i love it im finally doing it every day and someone is actually paying me to do so i can hardly believe it i have a long way to go but the team im in is super supportive and i cant wait to get the training wheels of and really get stuck in to something all in all going from an interest in python to working as junior python developer took me a little over seven years could this have been done quicker no doubt if i had the right focus from the beginning this probably could have been a year or two but if my grandmother had wheels shed be a bicycle this is the pace it took me and ultimately im really happy i know many of you learning have read similar stories before and i know mine may not be that different from others but hopefully a few of you might get some helpful takeaways from my story if i was to summarise the keys steps that landed me employment it would be these this is the tldr learn the basics of the language and learn them well learn about data types for loops while loops how to iterate through lists take inputs learn about booleans and boolean logic learn about functions and classes and perhaps a bit about object oriented programming i spent far far far too long on this step learn how to make something this can be anything for me this was simple calculators and games to begin with and moved on to simple programs that could rename files in my media folders take part in challenges that make use of programming i adore advent of code and the community surrounding it but there is also project euler code wars and im sure plenty of others take your time with these dont cheat by searching for other solutions before completing your own but do feel free to use search engines reddit and stack overflow for ways to achieve sub tasks within your solution when your done definitely go and compare against other people solutions and make note of why someone else might be better make use of tutorials and and websites such as codecademy but dont rely on them for anything you make during a tutorial make something similar but different making use of your new skills and using stack overflow to fill gaps in your knowledge for features that werent covered in the tutorial and that you dont already know create a github and upload everything you make tidy things up and and readme files to them soft skills related skills these are all the things you can transfer from other employment such as leadership teamwork effective communication etc but also related tech skills on my journey i learned how to use linux became comfortable with the command line and set up my own vps on digital ocean and one on linode this is not as difficult as it might sound if youve never done it before but it does take some learning find ways to implement what you learn in to your current job if possible automate some processes scrape useful data but really all of the above can be shortened to study the language build things showcase what youve built a massive thank you to rlearnpython as this has been one of the biggest sources of support for me over the years and id never have gotten this far without it if anyone is in a similar position to me prior to getting the first job feel free to ask any question or reach out for some encouragement edit thank you very much to those who have given me awards for this post im glad that this could be useful to many of you and it means the world to me that you felt strongly enough to send such a kind gesture but please can i implore anyone else who is inclined to do so please spend your money on another good cause instead send a donation to doctors without borders reddit has plenty of money ive tried to answer any question you guys have posted but if ive missed anyone ill try to make sure i get back to you shortly",

clearer explanation please feel free to comment class attributes variables owned by a class and shared by all instances of a class instance attributes attributes that are owned by once specific instance of a class and not shared between instances methods functions that live inside of a class the functions work the same as normal functions they are just called methods to differentiate them from functions that dont live inside of a class init is a method function that lives inside of a class that runs when an instance is created it is used to create instance variables self elf is nothing special it is a word used to reference the object the class is assigned to when you create instance variables with init or other methods self is passed to connect the methods to the object also prefixing variables with self allows every method in the class to access the variable and any instanceobject created from the class can access the variable classes blueprint instances things that can be made super helps python make connections between parent and child classes classes can inherit from other classes multiple inheritance when a class inherits the characteristics of more than one

    "etwubn": "tldr id like to thank all of rlearnpython from the bottom of my heart for being an amazing and helpful resource from day 1 of my python journey never give up on programming and never stop learning practice practice practice one year ago i started out with zero programming experience and zero security experience i got placed in my high school technology course to fill out my schedule i spent about two weeks watching bob ross and following along in ms paint before my teacher recommended that i learn something useful he mentioned something called python and told me to look into it i immediately fell in love with it it was fun to use easy to write and extremely flexible i struggled a lot when i first started and my first program took me longer than i care to admit it was extremely simple num intinputenter the number if num 1000 printthe number is 1000 elif num 1000 printthe number is greater than 1000 elif num 1000 printthe number is less than 1000 for i in rangenum 0 1 printstri i struggled for three days with type errors and the loop threw me for a loop it was frustrating but the feeling of reward and pride when i saw those numbers printed out correctly inspired me to stick with it those in my opinion are the two most useful virtues to have when learning programming passion and perseverance i poured time into python spending 6 7 hours a day programming and the rest thinking up projects and reading reddit posts about programming not long after i decided to move on from small programming exercises and start a real project i found that picking a project that forced me to learn new things about python greatly helped me i wrote a text based dungeon crawler and it taught me about classes function and dictionaries it a hot mess 4k lines of insane code you can see it here in all its nasty glory i was proud of it and i honestly still am the location system was insanely difficult for a new programmer and it even drove me to tears on a few occasions i was so proud i decided to enter it in my state technology competition in project programming i won local and districts but didnt place at state x200b after that i discovered my other passion cybersecurity like i did with python i fell in love with it and spent hours upon hours reading doing ctf exercises and messing around with networking i decided that cybersecurity was what i wanted to do with my life just like python what helped me most here was hands on practice and time getting stuck in a cycle of reading and not practicing is easy but you only really learn by doing doing hack the boxes capture the flags such as the ones at over the wire and messing around with vulnerable vms like dvwa and metasploitable was crucial to learning for me over the summer i got an entry level it support job with a contractor that worked with my high school it was a lot of grunt labor at first hauling obsolete systems off for disposal and such as the summer progressed we started updating chromebooks by hand for 9 hours a day i was bored as all hell so i turned once again to python i wrote a small script to scrape public text documents off of pastebin it was slow got banned every 40 minutes or so and really was just a stream of random data deposited in a onedrive folder for me to look through x200b over the summer and through the year i honed it into the crown jewel of my python projects it went from a shitty script made from boredom to a tool for malware collection and data analysis i dubbed it binbot and worked on it constantly i decided to enter it in the tech competition again i swept locals and impressed the judges so much that one judge offered to put in a recommendation to a manager he knew for a part time job at the google hq in atlanta today was the regional competition i presented binbot as an open source threat intelligence program i demonstrated how it worked what it potential in a security workflow was and to accompany it i walked the judges through an analysis of an emotet sample i did i showed how binbot alerted me to a potentially malicious url how i retrieved the malicious word doc and deobfuscated the powershell payload and fetched the live payload from a compromised domain and ran it through hybridanalysis they were extremely impressed and i won first place x200b afterwards the regional it supervisor and the head of the board of education came up to me and offered me a job as a database administrator they said the old admin has retired and that they wanted to hire me the work is fully remote and has government benefits which means i can continue doing it when i go off to college ill be setting up writing queries for and maintaining every database in the entire district im extremely excited and grateful thank all of you for helping me answering my stupid questions and never stop learning hack on brothers edit link to a markdown version of the emotet analysis",

    "hv9r5u": "5 interesting python modules these are some modules that might not have day to day use for python programmers but are still fun to try out and experiment with here are the modules 1 wikipedia it turns out that you can import the whole wikipedia into your python program simply run pip install wikipedia on your computer and import the module there are multiple functions in the module such as summary search setlang which can be used to create multiple interesting projects more info at 2 emoji this is a cool module that you can use to add emojis to your project the emojis will be displayed in the command line for your project to install it run pip install emoji more info at 3 turtle this is one of the most well known interesting python modules it comes pre installed with the default python3 package import turtle for graphics and simple 2d games this is a module primarily used for creating graphics and cool visuals more info at 4 pydictionary this is a module containing the whole english dictionary it can be used to find the definition synonym antonyms and translations of words to install it run pip install pydictionary more info at 5 arrow this is an interesting module used for advanced functions with date and time this is the more advanced version of the dateandtime module that is built into python you need to run pip install u arrow more info at i highly encourage everyone to try these modules and use them for usefulimportant projects at least for some of them hopefully i have given some inspiration for everyone to check out the many more interesting and useful modules that python has there are many more interesting modules in python but these are the most interesting ones that can suit beginners and intermediates feel free to add your own suggestions in the comments for this post also you can add your own opinions about these modules so that the readers can also get another perspective for these modules thank you all for taking the time to read this post",
    "ld5c3e": "i have been involved in many discussions on here where i tell people the best way to learn is by doing but i never mention what to do below are the projects i think would be best for python beginners 1 user inputs create an app that asks the user to input one character that must be a vowel continue asking for the input until a vowel is inputted you can also give user feedback every time a non vowel is entered or upon a successful input 2 write a function write a function that takes in a positive integer and returns its multiplicative persistence which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in the integer until you reach a single digit for example the integer 39 returns 3 you get this by taking 39 and multiplying its digits 39 which equals 27 you then multiply 27 digits 27 14 lastly 14 4 which is a single digit you had to multiply 3 times so you return 3 the integer 999 would return 4 3 calculator app build a calculator app that performs multiple operations use the skills learned in projects 1 2 try using many functions in your app one for each operation ex addition subtraction multiplication division 4 read write files build an application that reads a txt file and outputs a csv file the app should take each line of the txt file split the line into an array of words and write each line to the csv file with each line being a row and each word being its own column in that row 5 bots webscraping using everything you have learned in projects 1 4 build a bot that scrapes data from a webpage and writes the data to a txt file for example you can have a bot go into instagram and pick a random person following you output their name to the first line of a txt file then go into their followers and repeat the process by outputting the name of this chosen person to the second line of the txt file run this until you get to 10 names make sure you add random time pauses in your code so that your bots dont get recognized by the sites you are scraping if you have trouble starting this one take a look at using selenium webdriver here write your answers to 1 2 in the comments if you struggle with any of these projects we can provide guidance and solutions in the comments",

starts and stops in my road to that end i was able to understand the process of programming but never really pushed myself to have any real workworld applications to try it out on so for my 50th birthday i made a promise to myself that this would be the year that i actually learn python and create a program i started with the automate the boring stuff course and then figured out what problem i wanted to solve once a month i have to collect test results on the monitors that the radiologist use to read imaging xrays on the dept of health says we need to be sure the monitors are up to snuff and we have proof that this testing is happening normally i would have to click through a bunch of web pages to get to a collection of pdfs that are created on the fly that contain the test results then id have to save the file and move it to the appropriate directory on a server very manual and probably takes 30 minutes or so to get all the reports it took a bit of time but my google fu is strong so i was for the most part able to find the answers i needed to keep moving forward i posted a few problems to stack overflow when i was really stumped the end result is the code below which does the whole process in about a minute i am so proud of myself getting it to work and now i have this extra boost of confidence towards the other jobs i plan to automate i also wanted to post this because some of the solutions were hard to find and i hope if another programmer hits the same snag they could find it in a google search and use part of my code to fix theirs im on fire and have so

    "e8uo6c": "hi everyone one month ago i decided to learn programming i always enjoyed the idea of programming but never tried it so i started a udemy course on python and i was addicted from the first line of codeactually from the second i really hated the hello world programs i have a batchelors degree in a different fieldas you can see not in english so i never thought about programming as a new career i just wanted to start a new hobby 28 days later i really consider to change path to programming or maybe find a master combining my field with programming so for the last 28 days i studied and wrote code for 100 hours let me tell you about my progress from hour to hour and what i managed to make so far hour 0 hello world hour 1 15 learning the basic python syntax hour 20 i created 2 simple projects one simple dictionary where you give an input and the script returns the meaning ofthe word from a json file the second program is a simple script for runners which gets some user input about your running speed duration and heart rate and returns an estimation of your running fitness sound like a lot but it is just a simple calculator with some fancy equations i found online hour 23 things are getting interesting as i learn about webscraping instead of buildingcopying the program my tutor was making i instead decided to create a scraper on a different websitetheres a site called polar flow where running data from sport watches are stored so i created a webscraper that scrapes my data from my past acticities and using the equation from my last progress estimates my running fitness from every activity of mine hour 23 40 studied about numpypandasselenium webdrivebeautifulsoupcsv filesmatploidbokeh and other libraries hour 45 learned how to do linear fitting of scatter data in bokeh actually i have a good math background from my university studies so the math part was not hard i created my first graph in bokeh using the running data of my previous project to calculate how my running fitness increases over time hour 45 60 learning some basic things about oo programming and classes and pyqt5 graphical interface library hour 60 created my first one window program with pyqt5 now i had to decide create simple one window boring programs copying code from my tutor or take notes about the various code lines and how they work together and create a graphical interface for my running app project i chose the later 79 hour almost 20 hours laters most of which was me looking at a screen and wondering why my program doesnt work cried twice i managed to create a 4 window program the concept of the program is to get some running data input from a csv file and calculate running performance and vo2maxestimate then using some fitted equations which i created on my own by fitting data from 20 athletes the program estimates your training speeds as easy tempointervals ect the third screen calculates your heart rate zones and the forth screen shows a graph on how your stats change over time i want to add more functions to my program but i left it on the side for now to study more x200b hour 79 92 started reading more about some oop cause i dont really get it started rewriting my code without using copy and paste even from my one previous scripts and studied various online resources hour 92 101 created a shady instagram webscraper which does the following visits a profile and scrapes all the usernames that follow this profile then it visits every each one of them and scrapesfollower and following number data then calculates the ratio of following and followers andchecks from its last posts if it is an active account if it is an active account and follows more people than hasfollowers the program saves his link and username in a databasethe concept is that people who followmore people than get followed are good future follower candidates now i want to add a function to theprogram to auto like 5 posts on each of this account i created a second account to test all this and i wont tryto use it on my primary account i will get banned obviously x200b so that was my first 100 hours of programing i would be happy to answer your comments and questions and about your programing journey too x200b edit heres some photos of my running fitness project the dots in the plot are running fitness scores for individual runs and the line is the last 3 activities average something i want to clarify is that i am not good at programming yet my programs are buggy and my code is most of the times unreadable i use google and stack overflow all the time and i get stuck every 5 seconds at something x200b edit2 the reason i remember so clearly what i did in every hour is cause i logged every minute studing and coding in a productivity timer app i am a master procrastinator so doing things like this keeps me motivated i also kept notes of what i accomplised every hour to a spreadsheet knowing that one day it may motivate and help someone else do the same i wont stop here i am planning to write about my journey here or on a new post as i reach 200 300 hours the next 2 months will be a little slow but i believe until summer i will reach 300 500 hours x200b edit 3 i want to add some more things to the postadvicesthoughts and future plans edx and coursera has plenty of more university like courses on programming even from universities like mit and other known institutions all of the courses there are free to watch you only pay if you want to get a certificate also there is a financial aid program if you cant pay the full price but still want to get a certificate i plan to start a data sciencemachine learning course in the future the strugle with online courses is that most of them cover the basics and then you are pretty much on your own so i now i feel a little lost on where to go on and what to learn another strugle i have is that i dont know how to organize my code properly i dont know where it makes more sense to create classes when to split my script to two or more files and things like that as my projects grow in size i get the feeling that my code is like a giant with glass legs one little thing goes wrong and the whole thing colapses and sometimes i have to rewrite whole sections just to make it work i believe that if i learn to organize my code better i wont have such problems in the future use jupyter notebooks google it visit codewarscom it is a great site where you solve problems riddle like using programming you start from easy problems and as you solve them you go to harder ones do your own projects not the one your tutor does you will fail miserably but in the process of finding why you failed you will learn more stuff play with the code when i find a line of code online and put it in my project i switch little things to see how it breaks and trying to find out why this way i learn what every word and symbol in the line of code does and whats it role try to not copy paste code even if you wrote it in a previous project read a libary documentation when you start learning a new library dont google everything take some time to read the documentation you will get a better idea of what you can do with this library in the future",

    "t2m2g3": "hello rlearnpython time really does fly after losing my job as a chemist ive been a full time data engineer for just under a year now and have learnt so much i still feel a bit of the imposter syndrome stress especially as ive had a great first year needless to say the pressure is rising but that okay because you never stop learning this will be my last post in this beginner to beginners series the series was made as a bit of insight into a self taught programmer journey into the world of techit as well as a way for me to share my own experience with like minded individuals for lists of courses and generally more detail you can find the other posts from my series here just completed my first job on upwork going from printhello world to tutorial hell to building my own data pipeline from building my own data pipeline to my first technical interview from printhello world to tutorial hell to getting my first job dealing with first job imposter syndrome what project should i make and an oop epiphany ill do the usual openings and then get to the actual content further down background i am an experienced chemist who lost his job during the pandemic in 2020 during the process of losing my job i worked for a company who touted themselves as trying to be data first with extremely tenuous approaches to data management data science and infrastructure i thought i could do a better job than the management team so i taught myself originally the goal was to become a data scientist i was already a scientist how much harder can it be the more i learnt about data science the more i hated it was a slog learning was boring and i was never inspired but i carried on anyway i did my python courses i did a data science course and just didnt really know what to do at this point i started looking at freelance jobs and found some for my favourite thing to do webscraping it was here i had the revelation i loved automating the collection of data thus i accidentally discovered the world of data engineering this was over the course of around 5 months i carried on working on my portfolio i carried on trying to do freelance work it competitive i carried on working on my cv whilst struggling to find opportunity i signed up for a free zero to hero style bootcamp in python html and css thinking it would help in a good way i guess i had already done significantly more advanced projects in my spare time than the level of the course offered although i was optimistic that theyd see that and help me get a job during this bootcamp i started to get job interviews and eventually got offered and accept my current role this was over the course of around 45 weeks what i do now im a full time data engineer in financial services my day to day job involves creating new pipelines for internal customers managing access to data to users maintaining existing pipelines and services working on very simple front ends and vetting new tools for the company i work both on premise and in cloud although primarily i work in the cloud notes qualifications caveats for the reasons of transparency i think it always important to define a lot of this information to help people manage their expectations i have a masters degree in chemistry from a good university in the uk i have never written code before i started learning in late 2020 do not have any experience in my current field of financial services tech or it and did not get referred i do have experience being employed though and happened to be interested in a field data engineering which went and is still going through an unprecedented hiring spree and happened to have learnt the relevant stack and skills along the way luck is always a huge factor when it comes to jobs actual content the job market for data engineers is insane life as a chemist was usually spent finding the very few jobs around and competing with everybody in the area for it life in the world of data engineering cant possibly comment on the wider field of tech has been the complete opposite i get bombarded with jobs in calls emails messages on linkedin and my profile isnt really even that good i think i speak for the wider field of data that if that what youre into then it a really good time to be in said field make no mistake though it still competitive imposter syndrome doesnt go away you just kind of live with it like many self taught people imposter syndrome is a proper thing there are some days where i get requests and i just think how the fuck am i meant to do any of this do they think im way better than i am and there a bit of panic in my head whilst somebody is explaining the request once you start working on it though applying good principles and design concepts you start to get it and can get on with producing a good piece of work so my tip is if youre still feeling like you arent good enough and it never goes away for a long time then that alright a good team will always gives you time to get better and improve so long as you want to never stop learning i always imagined once i had made it in my job id just kind of hang out and coast through the day the reality is you kind of never really do and the moment you stop wanting to keep up is when you get left behind of course there are limits to everything being on the forefront and fluent in every single technology is pretty much impossible although striving to be aware of what out there and how industry standards change is definitely really key for moving forward advice for new programmers i always love to provide advice on how to go about getting a job in tech when youre self taught i think even after working for a year my advice hasnt really changed find a job youre interested in first do a lot of research here it might take a while recognise the stack youre interested in and start learning that stack build projects you are interested in first this in itself is a skill and will need time to learn i would say this is the critical point because being able to design and build projects is essentially you being a programmer so if you cant do it straight away that alright just keep trying apply for jobs youre interested in keep refining your cv and your project portfolio most importantly dont give up burnout is a very real problem if you are feeling exhausted and a bit defeated then take a break the job market isnt going anywhere and taking a day or two for your own mental health is never a bad thing whether youve been here since the start of my entire coding journey or youre brand new and looking for inspiration thank you as always questions are welcome and even if will take a while i will try to answer all",

    "gky9cs": "was recently helping out a family member of mine with their programming assignment kid is in college some intro to cs type class that involved python i dont know why it bothered me but seeing how slow he navigated through the file docs in general i couldnt help myself i showed him a handful of easy keyboard shortcuts that i suppose ive just incorrectly assumed most people know about them but apparently not after a little practice he told me it was some of the most helpful advice ive given him sometimes the little things can really make a difference like quickly reaching the startend of your line quickly moving things around in your file by highlighting to copy pasteetci typically am of the belief a mouse should rarely be used that not only brutally inefficient it for me at least would cramp the hell out of my hands if i was using a mouse all day to clarify i say that as it pertains to writing code obviously using a mouse to open different browsers or diff apps is a reasonable time to use it experienced programmers i imagine you use these along with others so this isnt so much directed at you but feel free to chime in and add anything you think might be useful figured this can at least help some people out should be noted these are done on my windows computer not all will be doable on mac and might require diff commands ill start with the home and end keys that apparently few people seem to actually know about home moves your curser to the start of the line end moves curser to the end of the line its on ctrl home moves your curser to start of doc | ctrl end moves your cursor to the end shift home will selecthighlight everything on the line cursor is on up to the curser shift end will selecthighlight everything on line after the curser if you wanted to quickly highlight a line to copy you press home to get to start of the line then press shift end to highlight the line you could also do the reversewhere you press end followed by shift home ctrl shift end wherever my cursor is everything after it in the doc gets selectedhighlighted ctrl shift home will highlight everything in the doc up to cursor ctrl leftright arrow to move your jump your cursor to the previousnext word on the line ex you want to edit the 3th word on a line hit home then control rightarrowto quickly get there ctrl shift leftright arrow to select the whole word if you wished to select multiple words keep ctrl shift held and continue to press leftright arrow to add shift updown arrows to select lines either above or below to include useful if you want to move those lines elsewhere with a ctrl x to cutpaste or just copypaste ctrl backspace to delete word cursor starts at end of word ctrl delete to delete word cursor at start of word can keep pressing backspacedelete in both ex to delete more than one word if you wish to delete full line can highlight the line del hit home then shift end then delete others ctrl will commentuncomment line the curser is on you can highlight however many lines you wish and it will commentuncomment all selected ctrl n new file ctrl o open file ctrl z undo ctrl y redo ctrl f find certain word tab indent to the right can be multiple lines if multiple lines are highlighted shift tab unindent or indent to the left ctrl c copy | ctrl x cut ctrl v paste ctrl a select all selects everything edit will add a few more upon reading comments the same indentunindent can be done with ctrl to indent and ctrl to unindent some shortcuts can be done in more than one way and are more matter of preference and what feels more natural its a perfectly fine alternative additionally ctrl h find and replace can be another great one rather than simply hit ctrl f to find a wordfind and replace not only locates the word but offers the ability to replace that word with a different word of your choice you can choose to replace only one instance specify youd like to replace the next as well or you can replace all maybe you spelled something wrong or updated a name and instead of scrolling through the entire file to locate each instance you simply hit ctrl h to find the word you wish to replace and enter the word you want to replace it with its worth noting this can get more complex with the inclusion of regex so ill leave that out of this post but any beginner who interested in learning about regex its incredibly helpful to know this is one ex that explains it but there are countless others dont be discouraged when you see it few people i know actually memorize every element of regex rather develop a familiarity recognize common patterns but dont feel discouraged if you cant memorize it allits extremely unique to what most of youve likely seen b4 everybody jumps in at me lol im strictly addressing begginers here who could easily have never seen regex before by no means feel obligated to learn it but it quite powerful so at some point it certainly can be quite helpful combined with ctrl h can do some cool things lastly heres another nice reply now you should all know how to format your code in reddit lol im sure there are others im not thinking about but for beginners i figured this may be helpful feel free to add other shortcuts you likefind useful",

same format as people seemed to like it this will be my story on how i went from essentially zero it experience to becoming a senior engineer @ faang location us age 28 my start isnt as philosophical as the above posters i worked a couple service industry jobs through my teens and 20 i didnt really have a plan in mind at the time but i was a pretty big gamer and had always been somewhat interested in computers throughout my life i knew some really basic networking to get my computer to have a static ip and knew the old dns is names pointed to numbers im not sure if i would consider myself the most motivated person but i think i would fall into the category of if i have an itch it needs to be scratched and most of my itches came in the form of wanting to know how things worked my first job i got when a manager of mine at in n out managed to get himself a position as a jr sysadmin and knew i was interested in computers at the time we had talked about computing and gaming over our time together at in n out so he had suggested i apply and put in a good word for me he @wadingthrulogs on twitter go throw him a follow ill link the resources that ive used throughout the years but i didnt really follow too many youtube channels specifically most of my experience comes from what i do on my own and the people that have taught me things along the way most of my book recommendations will be for programming but to be honest i didnt do much programming until i became a devops engineer book 1 design patterns elements of reusable object oriented software authors erich gamma richard helm john vlissides ralph johnson the big 4 i feel like this is the first on everyone list but use it more as a reference manual rather than sitting down and reading it front to back the things you build now may not be enterprise grade or all that fancy but its good to understand design patterns now and think of ways they can be applied when solving a specific problem if you find yourself writing a lot of boilerplate code over and over there probably a better way to do it 1010 recommended book 2 code complete 2nd edition author book by steve mcconnell another book in everyone list this one is a beefy boy but essentially is an encyclopedia of best practices and pragmatic guidance it comes with tons of examples and digrams that help explain best practice concepts and teach you how to be a better programmer by thinking of things differently that you would originally are you refactoring code here the recommended way to go about it starting unit testing well youre code will always have bugs but here is how you can build fault tolerance into your software etc etc 1010 recommended book 3 refactoring author martin fowler this book is quite good for when your getting into a new position and you need to take on a new codebase often times we find ourselves walking into a dumpster fire of code and need to know the best way of approaching a refactor this can take time and introduce more unintended side effects into the code than was there originally you should start adopting the idea of leaving the code cleaner than you found it now so that when the time comes you dont have to take 3 sprints to refactor a complete codebase but it all done as you revisit different sections of the code in your normal workflow 810 recommended from here on out i dont have many book or video recommendations but i will talk a little about my progression through my career as that may help some people in understanding where do i go next after they have gotten their first position position 1 jr systems administrator location datacenter what i learned problem solving critical thinking how to break down problems to small chunks just a note here this position while the title is misleading i was a glorified help desk operator taking calls and working on tickets i think the title only existed because i was slotting servers and doing basic administration my very first it job bright eyed and bushy tailed the company was a small datacenter located not too far from where i lived at the time in a small business park at this point i didnt really know much so i had to do a ton of self leaning on the job as i went my company had required that i pass the microsoft mcsa certification for windows server 2012 which involved the 70 410 70 411 and 70 412 certifications i was wholly unprepared because even microsoft themselves recommended at least 4 solid years of experience as a dedicated windows administrator before even attempting the test and i didnt even understand what windows active directory even was needless to say i failed the first exam twice and never ended up getting any part of the mcsa but more importantly i got moved to night shift where we got very few calls and tickets this time was spent now learning any new technology i thought was interesting while also looking for things i could improve on for my daily working life for example when we deprecated old bare metal servers we would need to wipe the hard drives that came out of them and install our baseline linux image to get them ready to be reslotted i knew that pxe booting was a thing but not really a whole lot on how it worked so i read the wiki watched a few videos and ended up standing up my own pxe boot server for us to use that would automate the process of wiping the hard drives and installing an image automatically all while it just needs to be plugged into the network port on our test bench my process was all about taking small bites out of a large problem and just googling how to do it until i had a grasp on what was happening i also learned basic bash scripting to install a lamp linux apache mysql php stack on a linux system by just writing the script line by line and re running it until it worked the main point being just how important it was to sit down and try things until you understand how they work position 2 cyber security operator i location soc what i learned understanding of it security more scripting but this time with python didnt see that one coming did you jr sysadmin to working in cyber security well it turns out the same manager that had helped me out getting my first job developed a more specific interest in it security and while i wasnt as interested in it the position paid way better that what i was doing at the datacenter and i absolutely hated working nights so i applied at the same place and ended up getting offered the position i started working with what i had learned from my previous position basic networking a concept of firewalls active directory how basic websites worked etc and learned very quickly about the security of all these things in my own time a huge shoutout here to the rnetsec community as they were essentially my every day read for new security write ups open source software that i found interesting and cool and an all around nice community after a few months of studying i went and took my network comptia certification the same concept that i applied in my last position i applied here im very lazy and so i want to build something that would make my life easier at work at the time i had been playing eve online for quite a few years before coming across a corp member that also happened to be a like 10 year cc programmer he helped me really get into the idea of programming with an actual language rather than just bash scripting and i chose python my first program i ever wrote was a calculator for how many times a ship or number of ships would need to pass through a wormhole to cause it to collapse on while you were stuck on the correct side moral of that story is that any example you can find of something to automate or write something about you should make a project out of i ended up also creating an auto hotkey script that would write the number of security event tickets required of me per day so essentially all of my day was spent understanding how these open source software i found on rnetsec worked and i came across a term or concept i didnt understand i would do some learning about what it was position 3 security engineer location electronics conglomerate what i learned more in depth security basics of engineering and the cloud aws this job isnt super remarkable for what i learned specifically but was nice was getting a title bump and essentially doubling my salary at the time which leads me to my next point a title change can be the difference in entire job families now there isnt really much of a difference between a cyber security operator and engineer as long as when you write your resume youre selectively putting your job duties that focus on building things breaking into the engineering tier with job titles is very beneficial because once you have that title on your resume you basically can always be an engineer anywhere you go same goes for operators analysts architects etc an example being i didnt really do any engineering when i was an operator but i did know how to write scripts and in my time learning on the job i did some reading on design patters see above book and put on my resume that i built scripts to automate the workflow of security events within my daily activities i didnt technically lie about any of that i did actually do it it just wasnt in my job description so always tailor your resume to the job youre applying for even going back to previous positions and tailoring your experience there to be more geared to the current position your trying to get what i learned here mostly was the basics of aws like what is ec2 s3 load balancers vpc etc and how to administrate a security appliance in our case it was a secrets management system that i wrote a commandline utility for positions 456 senior devops engineer location tax healthcare faang companies current position what i learned everything under the sun that has to do with infrastructure as code this post is getting to be a little long winded and ill probably just end up repeating myself but essentially getting into devops was the same process as the previous jump from sysadmin to security tailoring your resume and making sure to apply your time outside of work and the downtime you have inside of work to learn about new things in this case it for development operations devops it the new fullstack engineer because of the vast quantities of technologies you need to be familiar with to be effective to list the ones i use in my day to day off the top of my head aws eks cloudformation ec2 s3 ssm helm kubernetes bash docker golang python groovy java networking various different programming specific frameworks over time ive had to learn a ton of other technologies that all do similar things but just differently enough that the knowledge didnt directly translate like jenkins and octodeploy or ansible and salt stack essentially do similar things but their operating model and capabilities are different closing notes tips interviewing in the beginning youll pretty much have to take the positions that are offered to you until the time you gain the confidence to interview the company rather than the company interviewing you if youre comfortable teaching yourself things dont limit your job searches to things that only include your area of expertise if you like use django look for positions in python webdev not just django jobs and teach yourself the framework they use work on your soft skills this is probably one of the most important tips soft skills get you in the door and get people to like you if people like you they are more willing to help you out or give you a break i was a bar rat for a couple of months and it really helped me harness my natural charisma and general conversation find a social hobby that puts you in uncomfortable situations to help out with this there always more money in the budget for your role than you think there is if the average for a role is 100k the money on the table is probably closer to 120 140 of that if youre confident you can ask for the world i agree not to put technologies you dont completely know on your resume but it fine to put things you have a small about of experience with just indicate in the interview as such how much do you know about framework x oh i build a small personal project with it here a short description and the parts of the framework i used dress well if you dont know the answer to a question tell them you should also however follow up with your best guess at how it should be done conceptually anyone can google how to use a hash map but when interviewing i care more about when you would use one how you think is more important than what you know most of the time as it easier to fix thats really it if you have any specific questions ill be posting responses in the comments thanks tali",

    "ok45gi": "nbsp tldr follow up from my post a year ago asking how to present and automation to my cto he shits all over it and me in front of 15 people as he feels i made some big security oversitesattackedinsecuredidnt have time i decide to move to a tech start up i get a 27k raise i asked for 45k and they gave me 50k because in my new company people with my skills ie python are typically on 50k i then drop some key takeaways from my learning nbsp long version nbsp so about a year ago i made this post explaining that i had made a script to automate part of my job potentially saving my business about 360 hours a year sorry it took me so long to follow up but here the story nbsp i presented the script to my cto from start i got bad vibes the atmosphere was a bit tense there were a lot of people on the call and my cto is from america along with the rest of the dev team and im the uk meaning i had no relationship with anyone nbsp i showed off my script and of course i started having connection issues meaning my screen share was cutting in and out which took up about 15 minutes of the hour i can see my cto was getting pissed off eventually i got the script running it went well and worked perfectly nbsp the cto didnt say anything for a while whilst the other devs asked me some basic questions such as what language is this how long have you been coding what packages did you use whilst also saying that they were impressed that i had built the script in such a short time then the cto finally spoke up and said so those files you were uploading the data output looks like real names to me why have you got company data on your personal laptop barring in mind i couldnt install python on my work laptop i had used data from the company and like an idiot hadnt made it into dummy data nbsp i quickly apologised and he took the opportunity to go in on me he completely undressed me in the call in front of everyone taking the time to explain to me why having company data on my laptop was so bad and told me to delete every single piece of company data i had whilst share screened in front of 15 people barring in mind the data was only first name first initial email address hardly credit card details he then asked me if my username and password to access my company website was stored in my script in plain text i said yes because they were and he could clearly see that he then spent another 15 minutes raising his voice explaining lamenting how dangerous that was and how my packages could be stealing that data barring in mind i used pandas numpy selenium xlsx writer all very known packages nbsp by this time the meeting was essentially over and i was massively deflated my boss who supported me said that she will speak to my cto as it wasnt right the way he spoke to me in front everyone after my boss spoke to the cto he agreed to review the script i sent it over to them and ultimately i needed their help hosting the script on the company website after weeks of not hearing anything i chased them and they simply messaged back sorry we dont capacity to work on this project right now nbsp i was pissed off id spent probably over 100 hours on this script by this point working obsessively i decided to start searching for a new job nbsp i put my python experience on my cv and a modified version of my script on github and started applying for new jobs in tech startups where i felt innovation and automation would be appreciated i started getting loads of feedback and interviews interviews i felt were honestly outside of my pay bracket and grade the python script gave me confidence skills and something to talk about interviewers in some companies really really value a self starter who is going to work smarter not harder nbsp in the end i managed to get an operations analyst role with a tech start up getting a massive 27k pay rise it so crazy how it happened to my manager told me i got the job and asked me how much money i was looking for i said 45k and she said well actually i want to bring you in on 50k as that how much people with your skills in this company are paid like that is insane and shows how much value the python skills i had picked up meant and how creating a script means your interviewers really believe that they can invest in you as you will go out of your way to learn new skills to push my role to its limits nbsp for anyone looking to do automate a task at work here are my key takeaways nbsp 1 do it even if the company dont implement your automation i learnt so much more working on my project than i did watching tutorials or from coding books you cant beat real life problems and the motivation to solve the problem is 10xd when it really matters being able to put it on your cv is worth its weight in gold too when it comes to negotiating wages nbsp 2 look to automate something that is completely self efficient ultimately i had embarrassed my cto but automating something he and his team should have done years ago so of course he wanted to block my script the fact my automation needed to be host on the company websiteintranet means he could easily block it by saying his team has too much work to do work on things that you control completely make it hard for them to say no nbsp 3 always use dummy data dont be stupid like me and put company data on your work laptop and if you do when it comes round to showing your script pls use dummy data and delete the data nbsp 4 dont get your hopes up i was so deflated by the rejection and harsh treatment by my cto but you have to understand that devs and managers often have massive egos and seeing an upstart come in and write code that potentially makes them look bad means that will block your initiative out of spite jealousy or because they dont trust you be prepared for rejection and have adequate responses for reasons why you think they would dismiss the project nbsp 4 if your business doesnt value your automation look to move to a tech start up tech startups love automation they will give you the access you need to make a change and enable you rather than block you moving to a tech startup is the best move ive ever made and i dont see myself working for a massive corporate entity ever again nbsp 5 dont put your username and password in plain text in your script this massively tripped me up and i had no response to my cto when he called me out on this use something like python keyring library to encrypt your login and password so no one can catch you out as they caught me nbsp 6 attach a dollar value to the time saved this meant that my direct line manager manager couldnt ignore it and could see the value instantly",

bots specifically targetting scammers job application bot for linkedin less than successful a password manager and my own website after that i went into freelancing where i exclusively took on webscraping jobs what i do now i work full time as a data engineer in the financial services sector in the uk my job involves turning data collection jobs which were manually carried out every daymonthother time period into automated pipelines using python and cloud architecture note there were quite a lot of contributing factors into getting a job with the two most prominent being data engineeering is an absolutely booming industry right now and of course being in the right place at the right time aka lucky this is by no means a blueprint on how to get employed this is my personal experience and yours may differ overview in this post were going to deal the topics mentioned in the title perhaps youre somebody who is asking yourself am i really good enough and a little nervous to enter the industry or youre just starting out and want to know what it like taking on a career transition either way i hope this post has some value to you for those interested here are the previous entries from the series in chronological order going from printhello world to tutorial hell to building my own data pipeline from a beginner to beginners from building my own data pipeline to my first technical interview from printhello world to tutorial hell to getting my first job actual content but how do i know im good enough this is all too common as self taught programmers as we often lack the foundation of a lot of computer science principles which cs grads typically have the answer to the question is you wont know until you try which sounds like a cop out but it true if you are experienced and feeling a little unsure about if youre a good enough applicant i would invite you to be brave at this moment and throw out a few applications it was 4 weeks until i start my new job the first week of being offered it i was on an adrenaline high i couldnt sleep and just wanted to get working week two i was getting a little nervous as i began overthinking with thoughts such as what if they got me confused with somebody else maybe they overestimated my skill level i dont really even get oop wtf am i doing by the third week i was figuratively shitting myself going into this job although after i began it really wasnt that bad there was a bit of a learning curve to learn serverless architecture although the principles are really the same as doing your own projects version control via github comment where necessary and make sure your code is robust and easy to read ie no one letter variables functions where necessary and just make it so somebody who can at least read python code can understand your logic project based learning is king if you can make your own projects youre off to a good start if you make your own projects and publish them to github even better because youd be then writing code under the assumption other people are going to be able to see it so if you churn out something which works but is completely illegible it can speak volumes to a potential employer i honestly think id be struggling in this job if i hadnt made any of my own projects or took any of the very underpaid jobs during freelancing from my personal experience in industry a lot of isnt knowing the documentation in and out all of it is being able to justify why youre doing what youre doing and being able to get results this is where project based learning comes in doing course after course will not teach you these abilities and exactly why if youve been learning for a bit and youre asking yourself but what project should i do or how do i make projects you should make something anything challenge yourself to make something without copying an entire tutorial from start to finish it will suck it will be hard but you wont become a better programmer without feeling failure and ultimately success when to oop this is a fairly short bit about oop because it one of python biggest strengths although like many others i found myself wanting to use oop for the sake of using oop rather than really getting the point of it long story short oop like all coding paradigms is situational sometimes procedural code is totally fine because that all you need dont feel bad if youre building something simple for your own use and it doesnt use oop if you need something which is scalable and can be reused use oop as always questions are welcome and thank you for reading hope you enjoy",

    "jrwi6d": "holy shit that was a wild ride so ive just completed my first job on upwork and jesus god was it harder than i thought the actual job wasnt very difficult although i totally suck at programming so it took way longer than it should have i learn an absolute ton from it and wanted to share it with all you guys as a way of paying back for all the good advice ive been given the job the job was to scrape financial data from a bunch of websites which the client had already compiled the data was structured as an excel spreadsheet with hyperlinks embedded in text initial thought process cycle through the spreadsheet parse all hyperlinks into a list for later as all the data is from the same website im going to scrape one page and get all the relevant data then loop over it for the rest im going to add these values as i go along into excel through python this will be fairly easy what actually happened i spent about 30 minutes trying this in vscode setting up a virtual environment and after running my program a few times i realise i couldnt see shit at this point i got annoyed and transitioned into a jupyter notebook this made seeing what i was doing a lot easier and id recommend any data centric projects to be done in juypter i spent about an hour having trouble with list comprehension and loops turns out if you run a loop within a loop youre going to get it running twice and i wanted to run two loops parallel to each other i solved this by using for xy in ziplist1 list2 ive always said i hated parsing text because everything seems so complex today i overcame my fear using join split and strip this probably isnt much to a lot of people although it all came together for me today and it something im really happy with when it came to webscraping i got really lazy and paid the price for it i used list slicing on elements incorrectly and ended up having it so it worked for my sample size first two websites in list although when it got to the latter ones it started to do funky stuff so i had to start all over again before that i deleted all my code to start again because i thought i was parsing data incorrectly turns out it was just the unicode symbols for euro signs check it actually wrong before rage quitting sometimes plans dont go the way you want i was originally hoping to fire off a load of numbers from juypter into excel in this beautiful streamlined vision after spending so much time parsing text from beautifulsoup i decided to give up on that dream for today and instead think outside the box i ended up printing data to a text file importing it via excel cleaning it in excel edit i say clean it was deleting some punctuation marks and unwanted letters from the numbers and then copy and pasting it i think it also only fair for me to mention this took about 40 minutes i spent so long printing formatted output in jupyter and really enjoying it that i forgot about the task i spent a while getting the data to save horizontally with the right delimiter so i could copy and paste it into the clients spreadsheet there a lot of stop start especially as a non professional self taught person which feels fairly natural i think if you know what you want to do you can google through it with some persistence but if you cant say how youd approach the problem it infinitely harder like when i wanted to make my streamline dream so you might have to just give up on a fancy idea and stick to what you know sometimes hope you enjoyed reading edit thank you for all the awards really kind of you",

    "n171lw": "i stumbled across this subreddit 1 2 months ago by chance since then i have been pretty active here posting almost daily trying and mostly succeeding i hope to help people solve their python related problems now im by no means an expert programming is only a hobby to me and i work in an unrelated field i just want to share some of my experiences in the hope someone may find it useful anyway during this time i noticed a few reoccurring questions that get posted a few times a week 1 is xyz bookcourse a good way to learn python 2 i know the basics how do i get better 3 what projects can i do personally i think and from what ive seen many people agree the probably most efficient fastest way of learning python just my opinion is to get the basics down and then find yourself a project problem based learning i think what specific coursebook you use to learn the basic building blocks of python isnt even all that important though there are certainly better and worse options to choose from while this method has a solid support base the question of what project to work on seems to throw off many aspiring and even intermediate programmers the best choice is obviously to find a project of personal relevance to apply one skills it always more motivating to work on something that is useful to oneself however those projects are actually not always readily available or maybe too largecomplex to be suitable as a first project for a complete novice on the other hand writing a program just for the heck of it without anyone ever using it is far from motivating what i find curious though is that these people looking for projects are actually sitting on a treasure trove of real world programming problems waiting to be solved and they dont seem to even notice namely this sub since i found this sub ive been doing nothing else but opening posts and trying to solve the problems of other people oftentimes i only have a vague or no clear idea how to solve these problems however i think of different approaches and possible solutions googling and researching and once i find a solution i post it the idea is similar to rubber duck debugging when you want to learn something try to explain it to someone else if you cant explain it you dont actually understand it fully yourself this way in the past 1 2 months ive learned more also more diverse things than in the whole last year combined it a win win situation the person asking the question gets help and i get free real world exercises and more programming experience as a plus there are many people on this sub who different from me actually are experts so you get various creative approaches you can refer and compare your approaches to and what equally important you get feedback on your solutions if you are lucky in the form of comments telling you what is goodbad about your approach sadly though down votes without an actual explanation are more prevalent still better than nothing if you lack confidence in your skills solve the problem for yourself first and then wait for other people to reply compare the approaches and see if you can improve your answer on a side note i really wish people would give more feedback on posted solutions like any field programming is not a skill you ever master completely you get more proficient but there is always more to learn and in order to learn you need to know what and where to improve feedback is essential in learning anything a down vote is fine but please say what wrong with the answer thanks now before i wrap this up this is already longer than planned i want to give a short example of my learning curve that might encourage motivate some people i recently posted a solution to a pandas related problem which garnered a bit of attention mostly because i got lucky and implemented a useful method which many people up until then apparently didnt know about people called me smart or an expert which i found rather funny and actually embarrassing because it so far from the truth after all one month ago my knowledge of pandas was limited to reading in a csv file it just that after trying to solve other people pandas problems on a regular basis for a month i rather naturally learned my way around the library and this super useful method i used well i found it an hour prior in the pandas docs while i was looking to solve this very problem by putting in the effort to learn i didnt just help myself but apparently also many others my point is solving all these problems made me learn way faster and more relevant things than any tutorial book or course ever could while calling me a pandas expert is certainly very much over exaggerated my proficiency still rose exponentially i made similar progress in many different areas over the last 1 2 months eg i took a deep dive into python standard library a real treasure trove just by helping other people thus i can only encourage everyone to take part work on problems even though you may not know the answer initially take it as an opportunity to become a better programmer while getting karma as a bonus i hope someone found my ramblings useful have a nice day everyone and kudos to this awesome community since i highly doubt that people will actually read this wall of text tldr fastest way to learn programming is doing projects if you dont have a project try solving the problems on this subreddit as exercises free real world problems feedback and the possibility to compare your approaches to those of people who know their stuff also youre a good person by helping people plus you get karma to sum it up help yourself by helping others everybody wins",

    "es593y": "posting this hopefully as an encouragement for others who are struggling learning this stuff to keep going the hump that initial stage when youre first learning where everything seems either way too simple to be of any use or way over your head so that youll never comprehend it so you feel stuck and unable to progress any further then after some time you start to question how you managed to make it this far in life while being this stupid your brain labors to wrap itself around the understanding of these patterns and concepts that you know are simple logic yet they elude your comprehension anyway leading to tears of frustration and self deprecation i guess ill just work helpdesk my whole life you start to think hey at least it a job you look at others solutions to the practice projectsproblems and you think of course that was so obvious id have figured it out if i wasnt an idiot then finally after several weeks or months or maybe even years for some random reason or perhaps no reason at all something clicks in your brain you finally start to get it i first started trying to even have any semblance of learning to code like 3 4 years ago started with the free code academy python course and bounced around to a bunch of different courses and books lots of ragequitting lots of being busy with the working father husband life lots of just procrastination quitting and gaming instead lots of feeling stupid for not being able to think in simple logic but finally after trying to study and learn on the side here and there after starting and restarting automate the boring stuff like 3 4 times im getting to the point where i can actually figure out the practice projects at the end of the chapters without having to go look up someone else github to get a solution obviously i still have quite a long way to go but im finally starting to get over hump maybe im not retarded after all sniff so if youre also stuck trying to get over the hump just keep going and keep trying itll click eventually even if it takes a while i know that sounds oversimplified and unhelpful but that the same advice i got and ive found it to be true my current plan is to finally complete atbs then go through atbs 2nd edition just to see what new stuff is in there then go on to complete cs50 via edx and then ive got an android development course on udemy i bought a while back that maybe i can finally start on and then from there i dont know im open to suggestions im trying to get to the point where i can actually work as a developer and get out of helpdesk support and maybe develop my own android apps on the side but anyway tldr keep going edit looks like someone posted the new mit edx course so i hope i can complete that as well",

    "fj5lhd": "nbsp the full text is below but view it at to see syntax highlighting nbsp python if name main when you read other people python source code you may find something like this at the very bottom of the file if name main this is a construct that is confusing the first time you encounter it if name main is used to make a python file that is importable by other python files as well as executable on its own understanding if name main in order to understand how it works and how to use it there are a few background pieces of information you need to know part 1 when you are writing a program apy that imports another module bpy the code inside bpy is executed just like if you ran bpy by itself i know that sounds simple but it something people dont usually think about when practicing imports for the first time here watch bpy printim the b file python bpy im the b file apy printim the a file and im going to import b import b printim all done importing b python apy im the a file and im going to import b im the b file im all done importing b suppose you write a file called hextoolspy so that you can practice converting between hex and ints hextoolspy this library provides functions for converting to and from hex def inttohexx python automatically starts it with 0x which well strip return hexx2 def hextointh return inth 16 printinttohex4000 python hextoolspy fa0 it works great then one day you need to write a second program that also does some hex int conversion well instead of copying and pasting those functions it makes sense to just import hextools myprogrampy import hextools x intinputplease type a number printx in hex is hextoolsinttohexx now let run that program python myprogrampy fa0 please type a number that annoying the print statement inside hextools is executed and shows fa0 before myprogram even asks for input well that because all the code inside hextools is executed simply by importing it when i say all the code im referring to anything that written on the global scope anything which touches the left edge of the page that means the def statements which create the functions and in this case the print statement that we left there now you know that importing a file causes that code to run hold that thought it time for the second piece of background information part 2 python modules have some special variables in the global scope that are created automatically try starting a python interpreter and calling dir python dir annotations builtins doc loader name package spec name main ok so there an automatic variable called name which is a string that says main but let keep going to figure out what it means let start an interpreter with the i flag which runs everything in the file and then gives you the repl afterward python i hextoolspy fa0 dir annotations builtins cached doc loader name package spec hextoint inttohex doc nthis library provides functions for converting to and from hexn name main well there that fa0 again as you can see there is a magical variable called doc which automatically took the docstring that i wrote at the top of the file im showing that to prove that this is exactly what the variables look like while python is executing this file and we see the variable name which again says main one more demonstration let check that name variable again but with an imported module python import hextools fa0 name main hextoolsdoc nthis library provides functions for converting to and from hexn hextoolsname hextools aha so the name of my python repl is main but the name of an imported module is its name import os osname os import sys sysname ys import requests requestsname requests name main there is only one module that can be main and that whatever file we run directly anything you import will just have its own name part 3 let combine these two lessons together any code that you write on the global scope will be executed when you import that file into another but the magic variable name will only say main when you are running that file directly otherwise it will just say the name of the module bpy printim the b file and my name is name apy printim the a file and im going to import b import b printim all done importing b python bpy im the b file and my name is main python apy im the a file and im going to import b im the b file and my name is b im all done importing b this should drive the point home bpy printim the b file and my name is name if name main printthe b file is being run directly python bpy im the b file and my name is main the b file is being run directly python apy im the a file and im going to import b im the b file and my name is b im all done importing b therefore by putting code inside an if name main it will only run when you are running that file directly and it will be skipped if the module is being imported by something else there nothing surprising about how this works it just an if statement let apply that change hextoolspy this library provides functions for converting to and from hex import sys def inttohexx python automatically starts it with 0x which well strip return hexx2 def hextointh return inth 16 if name main x intsysargv1 printinttohexx myprogrampy import hextools x intinputplease type a number printx in hex is hextoolsinttohexx myprogrampy please type a number 42 42 in hex is 2a hextoolspy 42 2a now hextoolspy can be run on its own with an argument on the commandline and myprogrampy can import hextools and use its functions without interruption great job why doesnt python use a main function in some languages like c or java all you have to do is define a function called main and it will be run when you execute the file why does python use this somewhat awkward magic string variable instead in my opinion it for a few reasons firstly python spans a broad range of program formality levels if you just write all your code on the global scope someprogrampy import os for filename in oslistdir if ospathisfilefilename and filenameendswithtemp osremovefilename then youre basically treating python like bashbatch except a million times better in order to allow for this kind of programming python is already predisposed to treat files as a list of instructions to execute in order compare that with java where files are more like baskets full of methods and the order doesnt matter because main is where things actually start running consider also that in python you can do this def f printhello f def f printworld f hello world which you cant do in a language like c or java int f return 1 int f return 2 mainc75 error redefinition of f int f ^ mainc35 note previous definition is here int f ^ class main public static int f return 1 public static int f return 2 public static void mainstring args systemoutprintlnhello world mainjava6 error method f is already defined in class main public static int f and then there javascript which i guess must do a parsing pass before running but doesnt complain about redefines function f consoleloghello f function f consolelogworld f world world but anyway on the opposite end of the formality spectrum you can write python files where everything is tucked away into classes and functions and the file is designed as an import with no regard for command line usage of that particular file well if python already has the predisposition to just run all the code on the global scope why should there be a separate parsing mode and how would it know which one to use that not to say i love if name main i would prefer to have a separate main magic variable that is true or false then you can just if main the name string is still fine for other purposes like printing the module to the screen as a matter of fact whenever i upgrade a python script from quick prototype to reusable code i always move the main code into a c like function called main via this template def mainargv at this point i usually do my argparse return 0 if name main raise systemexitmainsysargv1 that because if you make any variables inside if name main they will be part of the global scope which may have accidental side effects for example badpy import sys def inttohex return hexx2 if name main x intsysargv1 printinttohex great everything ready to ship spot the error whereas by creating a main function any variables in main are local variables and are not accessible outside of it real life examples i understand that the examples shown here are very simplistic here are some links to my other programs which use ifmain in a purposeful way bytestring is imported by many of my other programs but also is very useful on its own epubfile can be imported into any program that wants to modify epubs but has a number of builtin utilities that run from ifmain in a very large project with many files it more likely that youll have a main launcher file and none of the internals are very useful to run on their own ifmain essentially bridges the gap to make single python files useful as imports and standalone utilities",

    "l1rsx6": "tldr lacked a deep understanding of fundamentals ass kicked by beginner hackerrankleetcode went back to the basics and im learning to solve my own problems using only knowledge of the fundamentals feedback is helpful background prior to two weeks ago i was doing and failing leetcodehackerrank style questions when i attempted them i only had leftover knowledge from one 3 month python course i took in my first semester pre pandemic late 2019early 2020 leftover knowledge from watching half of the udemy automate the boring stuff lecture series on and off from october to december fragments of knowledge from stackoverflow posts reddit posts and youtube vids i sought out for specific problems in the past not nearly enough right well i had no idea there was almost no question i could get right without checking the discussion section or googling something and they were all labelled easybeginner some took hours others took days it almost made me think i was stupid and want to quit i even stopped for a while and attempted one pretty large personal project that required an understanding of things like api third party modules git deployment services sql flask just because everyone kept recommending do project do projects do projects and while that generally good advice to gain some experience it wasnt for a beginner like me it took weeks i had zero concept of planning making a scope or writing pseudocode and i had to google more than just the new technologies i was trying to learn i was literally googling problems i had with the basics of python it was just too much different information to attempt to absorb at once until i spoke to people in the communitysubreddit discord and expressed my frustration was helped to get a sense of where i stand and decided to properly start my journey again from the beginning ive been diligently reading notetaking and doing the practice work on automate the boring stuff reading and physical notetaking has proven to be far more effective for me than watching video lectures plus the udemy series doesnt have any practice questions for you to do on your own along with each section and chapter of the book ive been supplementing my learning using the questions on practicepythonorg and reading their concept explanations for the past two weeks ive gotten every single question right without searching or looking at answers things like making a rock paper scissors game solving a list comprehension problem i didnt even know what list comprehension was while i was doing the hackerrank questions practicing string indexing loops iterators and using operators like modulo in conditional loops etc all these took was actively thinking about and applying the fundamentals id learned and as always some trial and error and in most cases by actively planning out my steps before even attempting to write the code i was able to eliminate any possible errors from the beginning minus syntax since i type too fast for my own good fast forward i hit my first hard level practice question today exercise 9 guessing game one and managed to complete it in about 30 minutes however what was bugging me was that the question scope didnt include or require any error checking like what if the user typed idk instead of a proper integer or exit i was used to doing that sort of thing with my personal project and had read about it in the book so i decided to throw in error checking in the conditional but couldnt quite figure out how to do it properly as well as make it clean and readable what did i do i built myself a function to check whether or not the user input could be converted to an int properly returns true and if not returns false would prompt the user to enter a valid integer x200b it basically def intcheckera try inta return true except valueerror return false i could then use the boolean return values in an if statement like guess inputguess a number if intcheckerguess true go check if it the right number elif guess exit do something exit else printthat not a proper integer or an exit statement do something this is obviously a common error to check for there might even be some standard library module or built in function that does this and there might have even be a way to check for it in the if statement itself but coming up with a solution on my own gave me a liiiitttleee bit of happiness okay maybe a lot that i was able to both identify a potential problem on own and successfully solve it using various things ive learned so far functions error handling boolean values conclusion i know this is a field where you can basically google all of your problems and as long as you know how to properly search for what you need youre good but a strong knowledge of the fundamentals is severely understated sometimes being able to solve my own problems with just a knowledge of the fundamentals and answering those practice questions has now become the little things that keep me going and reminding me that im doing well oh and having the confidence to be able to ask for helpfeedback from your peers instructors and just the community in general is the most relieving thing on the planet it can help you when youre stuck on anything from a simple error to your outlook on your skills and knowledge x200b tip if youre just a beginner to a programming language and youre seeing people say create projects see if you can make something like a number guessing game a rock paper scissors game or really long madlib game first also pace yourself so you can have time to really absorb the information stay healthy and make sure you enjoy what youre learning",

always someone wanting to know how to become a better programmer what magic pill or secret incantation that others do that instantly make them a better programmer invariably there is never a simple answer to their question often the answer boils down to here a bunch of tutorials do them until you know the syntax then work on a project that interests you this often leads to some consternation on the part of the op as they often wonder what project can i possibly work on if i dont know any programming often it seems as if they tentatively accept the advice and wander off into the wilderness to see if they can find this mystical project to work on sometimes you even hear back from them well today i wanted to take a moment from my own project and tell you this is the absolute best advice anyone can give you all the practice tutorials out there are wonderful most of them with the exception of a few that are looked down on by communities as a whole are fairly well suited to the purpose for which they were created teaching the syntax of a language see that the thing that most new programmers dont realize youre not learning how to program when youre doing these tutorials youre simply learning how to speak the language most people learn a few words in the language of python and want to write the next big facebook or go to work for google well let me tell you brothers and sisters that the equivalent of learning how to say parlez vous frances and wanting to immediately set off to write the next big french literary masterpiece it technically possible but so unlikely as to be completely improbable find a project sowhy learn all that language syntax from tutorials then squander them in trying to flop around doing more tutorials there comes a point where youre just learning things that dont seem very useful to you at all but you keep plugging through them thinking everyone says do this tutorial it got to make me a better programmer right dave right well let me give you an example of why it important to move past tutorials and go on to working on a project that you find interesting now no lie this is code that i produced in august of 2017 nothing special nothing fantastic in fact it was probably copied directly from a tutorial somewhere with very little understanding on my part until i began tweaking and moving it around now this level of code was where i stayed until the end of december when i started to get interested in an opensource python project evennia when i started on that it was the end of christmas break the kids were going back to school and since im a disabled stay at home dad looking for a way to become a better programmer and maybe start earning a little money to bring into the house i figured what the helli used to love playing on mudsmushesmoo back in the day why not take this out for a spin that ended up plunging me headlong into a project that i felt ill prepared forbut after the first couple of sessions of flailing around not knowing where anything was and asking a bunch of questions on the friendly irc chat the project uses i settled down and started going through their tutorials and working on implementing my own ideas it been not quite four monthsand this is the code im producing now granted there probably a lot wrong with it and im still nailing down how to implement unittests into my code effectively butit a hell of a lot more useful code that actually does something i know that it messy and not as good as some of the other stuff folks are doing but in the last four months ive learned on my own about python git how to set up a development environment how important standards are and why they exist and along the way ive been working on different things and ill ocassionally have a little flash of deja vu ill go back and look at a project and realize hey ive done something very like this in a tutorial these are the moments when all the seemingly pointless how to and automating everything with the kitchen sink tutorials start to actually pay off dont forget the secret sauce here the secret that a lot of people dont think to tell you until youve been working at programming for a while youre going to have a hard time of it youre going to spend a whole day on one method trying to figure out why it returns a list of tuples instead of just a straight list because something else is doing something you didnt account for seethat is how you become a better programmer by sucking at it not being satisfied with sucking at it you google the shit out of your problem ask on reddit ask in irc post on git or stackoverflowthat when you become better when you have something that youre working on that is more important to you to get working than worrying about why the syntax of joinstring and stringsplit look like that sokeep plugging along find something you want to work onsomething that you get up thinking about in the morningssome puzzle you really want to solve more than you want to watch that last episode of dr who do that and youll become a better programmer just be careful or the next time youre on reddit youll see someone asking how do i be a better programmer and youll invariably answer do the tutorials then find a project to work on i hope this helps some of the newer folks some the folks who are better programmers already i only ask that you not giggle too badly

    "g89tmh": "data analyst course with python introduction a few days ago there was a very well meaning and subsequently deleted post outlining topics to enable people to become data scientists in 12 weeks the post was heavily upvoted in spite of critical comments before it was deleted by the author the principle criticism was that it was wholly unrealistic to learn the topics listed in the time available this post seeks to provide something more realisticresources which in 12 weeks give you a flavour of data analysis with python and a basis for further learning important notes 12 weeks is nowhere near enough to become familiar with a language to the point of being consistently productive you will get syntax errors youll have to google youll get dismayed at the callousness of stackoverflow users this is normal and doesnt indicate failing on your partthis takes a lot of time total time spent learning is important but so is frequency if this takes 12 weeks full timeish it might take 30 weeks part time because you forget things more quickly business domain knowledge is super important if youre learning stuff for a particular industry try to get hold of data sets for that industry and feel free to skip stuff if you dont think its relevant though at this level little is irrelevant credentials im a data scientist with a maths phd unrelated to stats but somewhat algebra focused and was a quantitative analyst before that i work in the energy industry and spend a lot of time working with generalized additive models for time series forecasting chucking stuff at random forests doing bayesian inference with pymc3 and survival analysis with lifelines i dont use a lot of tensorflow or pytorch because they tend not to fit the domain of my problems well but i revisit them every few months to pit them against our existing models disclaimer this post is purely my opinion and in particular reflects my view that too much data science is more complicated than necessary perhaps because people dont have sufficient grounding in traditional statistics in my work this is hugely important if youre wanting to identify pictures of cats it really isnt learning resources python basics nothing here is specific to data analysis so just take a look at the rlearnpython faq data analysis theres no getting away from the fact that mathematics is at the core of data analysis but you dont have to be john conway to be useful in addition statistics is by far the most important at this level and you dont need to understand the minutiae of the subject which is based in measure theory and is tough unfortunately ive never found a good introduction to statistics with python there are plenty for r so you have to dip into a number of different resources python data science handbook jake vanderplas is the author of the excellent altair plotting library and a pretty bright chap this book serves as a good introduction to numpy pandas matplotlib and scikit learn and the link includes its full text as jupyter notebooks which is awesome you neednt bother with the scikit learn chapters unless you want to jump ahead all of statistics perhaps not all but larry wasserman has written a very approachable introduction to statistics here the link includes the few data sources given in the book but its very much a textbook at 500 pages its a bit daunting so i recommend focusing on chapters 111 first then the chapters on linear regression and multivariate models which is about 200 pages total read along with the scipy docs in addition take a look at pythonfordatascienceorg which calls out useful functions in scipy and statsmodels now available as a free pdf here thanks usududxb openintro statistics an alternative and possibly a better alternative to aos this textbook is available with an optional contribution and used by a number of colleges in the us ive not read it but a closer look it appears to be pretty great as with aos youll have to read along with the scipy and statsmodels docs python for data analysis and the pandas docs which of these you prefer is largely a matter of preferring one medium over another but pfdas second edition is already slightly outdated for pandas 103 though certainly not enough that its not a very useful resource data science from scratch joel gruss book kinda does do what i assert isnt possibletake you from zero to data scientist hero in a relatively short text the criticism i would level at it is that it necessarily doesnt go into sufficient depth everywhere but what it does brilliantly is implement most things from scratch duh to give you a good grounding in the basics anatomy of matplotlib this is a great video to get a better understanding of how to work with matplotlib which is definitely the least pythonic library still in use by data analysts today its also slightly outdated but hugely valuable introduction to survival analysis lifelines docs great introduction to survival analysis which will either help you look like a superstar or be completely irrelevant winning with simple even linear models i was at this talk at pydata london a few years ago and it was the best of the conference in my opinion vincent makes the argument that people are too quick to leap to mldl methods when simpler models could do as well or if not better data science briefly herere a few resources that cover data science proper but dont expect to get here any time soon rdatascience includes all the other resources in this section the elements of statistical learning and an introduction to statistical learning the former goes into more detail on the maths than the latter pattern recognition and machine learning andrew ngs machine learning course data sources as mentioned before if youre interested in a particular industry then see if you can get data related to it otherwise these are some general sources of good quality data scikit learn data has some really good toy datasets that are useful for playing around with descriptive and inferential statistics besides the skl estimators datagovuk and datagov have hundreds of thousands of data sets many of these offer a great opportunity to practice cleaning up data with pandas because they come in all shapes and sizes openintro statistics data sets used in this textbook",

    "me6n5e": "i just finished up this course a few hours ago final was released earlier today and i got to it after work ended up with 99 summary good intro course that gets you learning and implementing a lot of basic python functions then starts to get computer science heavy at the end which was meh for me as i dont have plans to be a programmer just want to automatescript in my new it career in either case its a good foundation to build upon with other material i tracked my time with an app and ended up usually 8 12 hours per week ill probably dabble a bit back into atbs before thinking of a project to do i have a decent enough foundation where i think google and just experimenting will help take care of the rest background econ major went into manufacturing then just started in it ive failed to finish a python course multiple times i think im on my 4th attempt of automate the boring stuff finally decided to commit to a class structure and paid for the cert mostly to support the class but also for a little more motivation auditing the class gets you the finger exercises and problem sets which are the meat of your learning the midterm and final werent very vital just additional reinforcement of material if you cant spare the money youre not missing much content specifics the course starts off slow as any intro undergraduate course does i already had some basic knowledge from atbs but i will say i think unitpset1 is one of the more difficult problem sets and the tas said as well i think there are some things we havent yet been taught that made the questions harder unless you already knew other concepts unitpset2 was also fairly difficult for both of those i felt very stumped and not knowing how to move forward on finger exercises and problem sets i posted in the discussions about the expectation of our time spent because i was spending way above the estimate and they were estimating most people would be spending in 12 16 hourweek range and i felt i was exceeding that that didnt end up being the case as time went on needless to say i was very frustrated and banging my head against the problems but did eventually triumph and get the outputs that i wanted it felt very rewarding to finally get there for unitpset3 i really got into the flow and was proud of my work they had us write the internals for a hangman game which i eventually shared with programming friends the structure and docstrings of expected inputs and returns really helped solidify the lessons of abstraction and breaking down the work that gave me a lot of confidence to move forward with the other problem sets the later problem sets werent easy but i kept iterating and debugging and trying thingswhich is what unitpset 4 is about which made me feel less stumped and just gave me more practice and notice patterns on how to code that said unitpset 5 was a doozy again with introduction to classes and some other topics i had never previously touched honestly i still need a lot of practice on inheritance and how to use attributes but i feel that it will come with time as i practice more unitpset 6 was entirely multiple choice and more about computer science and efficiency primarily going into big o notation the intro to it was frustrating and imo not very good because you had to come up with expressions for your code eventually you end up with big o notation which throws away the need for the specific expressions and has you only focus on the largest which is easier to understand imo and with more finger exercisesproblem sets to practice through you learn the patterns and the topic better to give you an idea on how to write more efficient code however i feel the topic is still meh if i just want to automate some basic things i just dont feel id bottleneck a modern pc but i could be proven wrong it is still useful last unit 7 is kind of glossing over plotting more of a lead up to 6002x which i dont plan on taking for now tests the midterm and final were alright i dont think its entirely necessary for your learning but its good structure and feedback in both cases theres some initial multiple choice questions before you get to the programming thats the only place i lost points cause thats one try only the actual programming exercises had a max 10 attempts since you should be testing your code with test cases beforehand anyway i usually only need 1 or 2 attempts really they arent too complex compared to the problem sets although i will say i just got stumped and spent about 2 hours on one problem before i skipped it and came back to it and got it done in less than an hour overall the grader and its feedback had a lot going for it that helped me learn but they still need some minor improvements to reduce vagueness in the answer they expect since the grader pretty much expects an exact output in most cases anyway hope that helps people out there community eh not a big factor for me as i thought it would be forums are okay though awful to navigate imo tas are helpful but for the most part i just experimented to work through issues they are also available on discord",

    "f2cveb": "hi 2 months ago i wrote a post about my first 100 hours of programming which you can find it here x200b photos due to work and some minor health issues i couldnt keep up with my coding streak 100 hours of coding in 28 days so here is what i have done so far 100 105 hours i rewrote my pyqt5 gui this time without using qtdesigner qtdesigner created some unreadable and complicated for me code so in order to learn better i had to delete my program and rewrote it from the first line this time using my own code the final product was almost half the lines of the original one the problem is that even thought people say that qt is a powerful gui creator i never managed to create complicated stuff with itmaybe i dont have the coding knowledge maybe the documentation isntt noob friendly and rich i had to give up and leave my project unfinished this is where i decided that learning and writing gui in the form of a webapp might be more efficient and greater skill to have so i started reading about python web frameworks with the goal to write my fitness app in mind the 2 obvious choices where flask and django i picked flask cause i heard that is more begiener friendly 105 106 intalled flask and found some tutorials online so excited to learn something new one hour later i had to give up cause i realized that i need to know even some basic html and css to write a web app 106 115found a udemy course in front end web developing and started learning about html and css in the meantime i watched millions of youtube videos on the subject and started to design on paper how i want my app to look like i decided i want an admin dashboard look with a sidebar and graphs and data on the central body i watched more videos about flask and html when i found about bootstrap 115 119 for the next 4 hours i tried to download and use premade bootstrap dashboard templates but for some reason i couldnt make it work with flask i tried various fixes but due to being a noob i decided to give up complicated premade templates and create my own ugly and chaotic front end 119 123 created the front end of my web app 123 132 started a youtube flask course by corey schafer i tried to watch this tutorial before when i knew the basics of flask with no success it was too complicated for me now that i knew the basics of flask and also html and css this tutorial was the best thing i could find i coded along watching corey tutorial but instead of creating the blog he was making i used the same techniques to write my own app i created an sqlite database where the user can log in his past activities data then i used this data to create some very complex graphs and tables about the runners fitness 132 147 it took me 15 hours maybe more to create 3 graphs i used pygal in the begiening but due to a bug i had to switch to bokeh i consider this graphs very complex and i learned many things in the process in one graph i created 3 different lines with show the fatigue form and fitness every single day until today this was quite hard for me cause not only the equations were not simple but also i wanted my graph not to show one dot for every activity but one for every single day even if that day you didnt exercised at all so i had to create a dataframe with one entry per day from the first activity until today and then check which of these days there is a logged activity i also created some tables in which you can see your aerobic and tempo speed depending on your current fitness level all these ideas werent mine to start with there are apps that do pretty much the same but they are not open source for me to get some ideas on how they work also the table with the speeds is something all these apps dont have and i am happy that i created that for mine so what next 1 i want to make the front end prettier 2 learn how to use github and share the code with you people can benefit from it and also you might give me some good insights about how to write my code and what to do from now on 2 add delete activity functionality right now i cant delete past activities 3 create one more page with a personalized running programm depending your current fitness level and past weeks activities 4 create a register and log in for new users page and functionality this will be the hardest i dont even know if a noob like me can pull this off 5 gather data from real runners and make better equations about the training speeds and zones right now i used data from my own runs to create a scatter plot about different speeds and heart rates i created a linear fitting line and found it equation with this equation i can give you running paces and heart rate zones depending on your fitness level x200b right now my app can only work on local host cause i dont have multi users functionality so in the future i want to either host it online if i manage to do 5 or somehow package it to work offline with an sqlite database with only one user some people might think that i am obsessed with running well i am not i workout only recreationaly but i love data and i have a fitness watch and heart rate monitor when i started learning programming i realized that i can use all this data to create apps as i learn i dont like the idea of using weather data and other online dummy data i like to create apps and scripts which i can actually use i am an amateur photographer so maybe my next step will be to learn how to compine this with programming sorry for typos and bad english i hope this post will give you the motivation you need to go on in your coding journey also any insights about how to proceed would be very helpful especially from people with more experience than me feel free to reply or send me pm about anything please just dont send me pms like help me learn code i would love to help you but please say at least hi first edit i managed to learn the basic of github and uploaded my project there feel free to check it out someone told me

    "mcn939": "i love learning python it fun and usually easy to understand while having powerful applications but throughout my journey i have have noticed some things that i have disliked fyi i consider myself to be at a level form a scale from 1 to 10 being 1 complete noob to 10 god of programming something close to a 3 maybe 1 starting to learn is overwhelming there are so many resources most usually bad they dont hold your hand it took me months to finally start learning 2 automate the boring stuff is an amazing intro but once you reach a certain level they seem very simplistic and i dislike how the author doesnt use the base libraries and instead recommends others 3 so much code online that uses depracated code that no longer works with python 37 is annoying 4 likewise python 2 users stop using python 2 get with the times there python 3 and maybe a 4 soon so much depracated code online meant for python 2 instead of python 3 and it usually doesnt work making me bang my head against the wall for hours wondering why it doesnt why still code in python 2 5 unless my program is extremely simple most of the times i have no idea how to program it which lends to hours on the internet trying to find code that does what i want it to do or interpret snippets of code that is close to what i want to do and mold that crap onty my program and hope for the best its extremely time consuming 6 coding isnt so obvious and it definitely not for everyone there is a steep learning curve if you have never coded anything or even typed an if statement i excel 7 i only paid for one course python for research by hardvard although i understand the concepts i takes me 10 times as long to test each program they talk about because i want to understand it and they go so fast so a course that takes someone 2 months is taking me closer to 5 definitely not for beginners 8 some documentation for how to use some libraries are extremely vague leaving you hunting for proper examples on how to use the damn thing 9 there seems to be no easy way to share a program for people who are not programmers to use the program you made i still struggle with this 10 sometimes my programs are slooowwww for example an email program im writing just getting it to list all the subjects of all the emails takes forever and im sure there is a better and faster way to code it but like i said documentation is extremely vague that the frustrating part knowing there is probably a better solution but you have no idea what it is 11 actually finding a useful use for python is harder than most people think you have to be really creative with and interesting problem to solve whose solution doesnt already exist with some other pre existing programs my mantra lately has been python is usually the answer if they ask me to do something at work sometimes it pays off sometimes it doesnt it a huge bet usually 12 the example exercises bored the crap out of me i wanted to run when i didnt even know how to walk and that was a rough road because my first usable program was using the api of the e commerce site to make a report it was the deep end of the pool and it was hard learning about it 13 your google fu will fail you sometimes because you are not sure how to ask the question you need the answer too because you still dont know the lingo i want the thing to do the other thing is difficult to search for 14 when some courses show deprecated code and it doesnt work when you try it yourself and you waste hours trying to figure out why and then once you find out the code has an error searching google for the correct way to do it what i do like so far 1 people actually seem impressed when you know at least some python really stands out in an interview and even more so when you used it to solve something at work 2 it fun and you have to be really creative when shit works 3 it can be magical sometimes the range of functions python has there more points im sure ill edit this later but i dont regret it i like python but it definitely not for everyone i hope to keep learning thanks to everyone in this sub they are very helpful to get me unstuck sometimes",

used python occasionally in the past at my current job which is sort of research focused so i work with datasets data cleaning merging etc looking to transition more into a data science esque job which seems to be basically what i currently do now except more advanced at a bigger company only like 2 3 years of work experience did not major in cs but did do social science and stem bachelor dual majors at a very good us university for background a few quick questions mostly related to imposter syndrome perhaps not 1 i feel like i write very straightforward code in the sense that if i am tasked with a dataset and need to clean and reorganize it ill do the straightforward thing to get from point a to point b once i check out a dataset and know the typically not that complicated instruction on what i need to get ill instinctively have some ideas on what to do obviously while implementing i will run into some issues dataset not cooperating with parts of my code etc but i can usually figure out a workaround however the code is not sexy so to speak at least in my view but i do document my code or write a quick comment here or there use understandable and intuitive variable names and all the good coding habits mostly there are times i go back afterwards and look at my code and think yeah i could have maybe turned this section into a function since i re used it a couple of times and just copy pasted each time and similar stuff but the code works fine and people should be able to follow it since it feels braindead straightforward from how i approached and programmed it i feel slightly weird about this because it feels like all the stuff i do is super basic that anyone can do is this just a case of imposter syndrome with coding or am i possibly underselling myself mentally 2 programming by googling i must say i retain very little syntax since i swap between a couple of coding languages eg r matlab and honestly i couldnt care to remember all the details if i type something wrong and my program doesnt run ill just fix the error that pops up when my syntax is off but more specifically let say i need to use pandasnumpy to reorganize datasets i dont have basic pandasnumpy memorized each time ill have to go look up a quick tutorial on some common functions but once i remember the syntax everything is easy since i know pseudocode wise in my head what i want to do to get from a to b for instance in my head ill be like oh okay i need to delete these columns since we dont need them then join a to b sanitize by removing nulls in this column etc each of those steps i might forget how to do so ill just look up how to delete a column pandas how to join tables pandas how to find nulls pandas grab the line of code then throw it into my program 30 seconds later my code runs and gets me a nice dataset for the next step and i forgot not really how to do the previous stuff already again i feel slightly guilty about this since i dont really have things committed to memory but part of that might be i dont use python a ton but is that going to hurt me or is the fact that i know what i want to do and can quickly google the syntax line more important in the long runrecruiting stage 3 how much python do i actually need to know for a somewhat entry to mid level data science job i look at a lot of crash course in python for data science stuff that people praise online and i look at the syllabus and they cover for loops importingexporting data creating plots etc i do all that sort of stuff in my current work albeit not necessarily in python and ive been told and i know that im a quick learner with good communication skills so i know that if my tasks are here a dataset clean it export it create some plots to visualize the data in python i can reason out what i need to do after confirming exactly what needs to be done and then go googlesearch up the appropriate code to put the pieces together see question 2 so in effect i already know the material in the course the fundamentals behind loops dictionaries etc and i can work out the syntax easily with resources but that seems super basic no which is why im sort of unconvinced that my current skillset is enough for an entry mid level data science esque job again maybe imposter syndrome ive been coding occasionally since high school currently mid 20s so i definitely have a decent mindset on knowing how code works and it feels like second nature to implement all the basic stuff which is why i say i write straightforward code but it all feels too simpleam i correct in that i should be looking for more specific advanced stuff which is tacitly required for a strong entrymid level data science position or is it really just that truly what you need to get your foot in the door and youll pick up skills as needed by tasks assigned to you for instance i know that projects are good to have to show what youve done is there a list of solid projects for strong mid level data science positions so i can gauge how complex they are for example i like sports i havent done any python web scraping but im sure i could find a website to scrape basketball statistics from learn how to implement that real quick and then write code which visualizes scoring streaks or investigates some sort of basketball related numbers question eg how does team a turnover difference compare to team b turnover difference or what is the correlation between average points scored per game by a team versus win easier said than done of course but im confident i could do that within a couple of days if i really tried to is that enoughtypical work for so called data science positions sorry for a longish post but thanks to all who have comments and replies",
